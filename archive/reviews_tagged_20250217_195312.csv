"I bought the Diamond Necklace ($298) for my girlfriend to match a ring that she has.  She tried it on when I brought it home, and the chain broke while she went to remove it.  Literally immediately.  Clearly, there was a defect in the chain, because she didnt pull at it, didnt get stuck on clothing or hair, it just fell apart.  She immediately submitted a customer service claim (which purports to respond within 24 hours).  After 6 days, they finally responded and said that they will not be honoring the Warranty Policy because either:1. the claim is outside the two year period (false), 2. the item is lost and not in our possession (false), incorrect materialcare was provided to the piece (false, it was just taken out of the box), normal wear and tear such as scratching or bent (also false, again, it was just taken out of the box), or a third-party vendor was used to repair the item (again, it was just taken out of the box).  This company is a complete scam, they clearly did not read the claim and just automatically rejected it.  I will be disputing this purchase with my credit card.

The painting of their facade was blocking the entire sidewalk for hours at an extremely busy time of day on one of the busiest streets in philly for foot traffic.

"I purchased an emerald baguette stud earrings less than 2 months ago.  Ive worn it twice. I love it a lot except the other day, it totally fell off my right ear. It almost went down the drain as I was washing my hands. The 14k gold backing for some reason did not fit eventhough Ive had it on all day. Weird! I went back to this location to make a complaint. I was greeted by the manager, Emma. She quickly replaced my backing and gave me an extra one with no questions asked. Excellent customer service! This is the 2nd pair of mejuri earrings I own. The jury is still out on the quality but I do like the customer service Ive had in both, Philly and Calgary stores.

"Yesterday I went to buy my daughter a Christmas present, I wanted something simple and beautiful.

I was overjoyed how fast and simple it was to complete my transaction. And every question I asked Daze knew the answer.

"Whatever you do, dont buy from here. We have purchased 5 pieces of gold jewelry and 4 broke in under 2 years. Unfortunately we werent aware of their limited 2 year warranty, and they wont do anything for us since its been a couple months over 2 years. Gold chains and gold clasps should not break in half. Go elsewhere.UPDATE-Since this review, they reached out and after lots of back and forth, they replaced some of the items. Its truly unfortunate they didnt take care of us as paying customers.

"I went to the store and the store associate made the wrong order of the item I wanted ordering the bundle to my house and not just the earring single. Now I have to make the return online but that is not being done correctly due to the confusion. I told and showed the store associate what I wanted in person and on my phone but she still managed to order the wrong item, creating more of a hassle and problem for me, in which I am still out of the amount I paid because I did not get the refund (for a wrong order I did not place nor want). It is not a small amount and the customer service is lacking for a place that sells overpriced and expensive jewelry. Please make sure to confirm with the customer that the order that is being placed is correct before charging the customer $200 !

"Im happy with the jewelry I purchased and the customer service I received from the sales associates, but am disappointed with the lack of professionalism from the piercer. She was 25 minutes late to my scheduled appointment and she also told me the incorrect price for some of the jewelry I wanted, so I ended up spending more than I had expected. I only realized this after checking the receipt in my email inbox, which arrived after I left the store, and when I called back to get clarification on pricing, all the piercer said was that she was sorry that she must have incorrectly memorized the pricing. For the amount I spent on jewelry and the hour I drove to get to my appointment on time (since theres only a 10-minute grace period), I expected more from Mejuri. Based on my experience, I will likely not be visiting again any time soon and would not recommend the piercing studio at this location.",Bethesda,0.0,11/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,3,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Michelle Kim,Failed,,
"Super nice & personable staff! But the quality of the Jewlery is really questionable…. Ive had issues with now 2 pairs of earrings from them & with the price point it wouldnt really make sense to pay almost $300 for a pair of earrings that just fall off your ear after 1-2 months of wearing them. Also gotta kick rocks if you do because warranty doesnt cover that! The make and quality is just, weird? White gold but I dont know…. Cheap white gold? Ive never had earrings just fall off my ear. The earring backings on most of their earrings are so cheap looking and cheaply made. For the earrings that clasp on, they just arent made the best so the clasp ends up not… clasping.. They suggest to buy plastic earring backings from Amazon to help keep them in. But Id hope if I buy a diamond gold earring the earring would kinda stay in my ear, ya know? 5/5  location, 5/5  customer service/staff, 2/5  Jewlery quality, just go for the rings Id stray away from earrings",Bethesda,0.0,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,4,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Britteny Etienne,Failed,,

All of the staff seemed to be overwhelmed understandably so, however the lady that help me and my friend seemed as though she did not want to help us. A line was created to try and get assistance and the employee seemed to try and skip right over us after helping the woman in front of us she literally did not look at us/ greet us and just skipped right over to the woman behind us. It was quite rude and i didnt get her name. She also sent my confirmation to wrong email.

"Mejuri is based in Toronto, Canada and has made itself known for its fine and semi fine jewelry. Mejuri offers a large range of accessories from Diamond rings to Amethyst bracelets, carefully crafted with sustainable materials.As someone who loves fine jewelry but understands the importance of budgeting I love how Mejuri is so budget friendly starting at just 35$. Mejuri is a step in the right direction for luxury jewelry that is both accessible and sustainable.Having worn multiple of Mejuris pieces, Ive found them to be quite modern yet elegant. This jewelry is luxurious, sustainable, and practical for everyday wear.Some pros of Mejuri are its affordable price, quality materials, and sustainability but it does have a few cons. Some pieces are less durable and dont last as long as some of the more expensive pieces and some people find it to have too little range of styles.Mejuris products are aimed towards people with more modern values of quality and ethical purchasing. Its for the people who want some luxury to their lives without having the quilt of being too extravagant.The shopping experience at Mejuri is straightforward with a user friendly website and clear descriptions of products. Alternatives to Mejuri that fit its ethical and quality standards are Catbird and Blue Nile.Overall I would give Mejuri 5 stars for its commitment to making quality and ethical luxury jewelry. Although it might not fit everyones style its a compelling option for those looking for cheap, sustainable, and quality luxury jewelry.",Bethesda,1.0,6/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Hen Rockman,Failed,,

"I had a terrible experience with Mejuri. The first pair of earrings I bought was defective—the clasp on one wouldnt open, and it got stuck in my ear. When I finally managed to get it off to send it back as a defective product, they had the audacity to claim the earrings werent in the box. Whether it fell out due to their mishandling or they didnt properly check, thats on them. Why would I keep defective earrings?Still, I decided to give them another chance and ordered a new pair. The same issue with the clasp happened again. This time, I checked the clasps immediately after opening, and they went right back in the box and were shipped back. Mejuri then claimed the earrings were in ""bad condition"" and refused to refund me—even though they never left the box for more than a few seconds.This company operates like a scam.

"This is not the first time I bought a jewelry in Mejuri. I always order online and have it deliver to my place. When I heard they opened a store in Montreal I got excited thats why this time I decided to pick up my order and check out the store. And I just did today, I bought a mini hoop 14k yellow gold, it is actually my second mini hoop. But I noticed the mejuri tag is missing and I dont see the 14k unlike the old mini hoop I have. As you can see in the photo, the one on the right is the first one I bought few months ago there is a tag on the side while the one on the left has none. I was told by an agent I can have it exchange because there should be a Mejuri tag :(11/30/2024 Update:I went back to the store this morning and one of the staff said  the law dont allow them anymore to make the hallmark or tag to be easily visible. She pointed a super tiny marking inside. It is so small, so hard to see and read even with a magnifying glass.

"Subpar customer service. The return policies are all over the place and the employees are unknowledgeable about their own job and procedures.

They made me make an account and said the store credit will be transferred there, however I later found out that the store credit was never transferred there. I called the store explaining the situation and said that the store credit could only be given to the person who ordered the jewelry and could not be sent to me directly. So, I made an account for no reason and the employee who helped me in person had no clue what they were doing either. I had to bother my aunt for the store credit, I gave them her email, but after a day she never received an email containing the store credit. I called the following day and explained she never got it, and they sent the store credit to my email directly.

"My sister and I have been return customers to Mejuri since this summer. I bought my sister a necklace for her birthday gift from Meijuri. We visited the store in Montreal on Dec 26 at 2:30pm.  She wanted to exchange the  necklace for a bracelet. The necklace was a 50th bday gift for Nov 7 and this was the first opportunity to exchange since one of us lives in Toronto. The service we received was so horrendous that we left determined never to return.  The salesperson was rude, unhelpful and arrogant. As repeat customers, the exchange my sister wanted to make would have provided Meijuri with a higher profit but we were immediately referred to the «30 day limited exchange policy» with no opportunity to explain the situation.

The first employee I spoke with proceeded to prioritize other clients once he became aware of my item being out of stock and did not notify me. I had to talk to another employee to get an update.

"Problem number 1# 14K gold fades the gold sheen with in a month and half just from sweat and exposure to air. Jewellery is meant to be worn. They should consider protective coating for longevity and durability. which the Jewellery does not have.I bought the garnet and gold ring. The fading was a fate I had accepted for an $800 ring. I shouldnt have because $800 could get you 22k rings which would have resell value. But the choice is yours.Problem number 2# Damages easy. I got a second ring for $515 the croissant ring. Wore it once. When buying it I asked if I am able to return this if I dont like it tomorrow, the sales rep responded yes.I came back to find out this wasnt eligible for a return because theres a slight scratch (invisible to my eye but they apparently have equipment in the store). I was only give the option to exchange. I told her that it did not make sense she is taking back the ring anyway but not letting me take the money back. Pretty scamy since mejuri swears on sustainability and using recycled gold and silver upto 90+ %. Store manager with red hair mentions the store will not be able to sell it and LOSE money. And she was sorry the sales rep had a miscommunication and did not tell me the conditions of return especially when I asked if I will be eligible to return.This wont  reach you, but Sales reps. I know you need to upsell a product at a store and offer advise but when people give you their budget please be accomodatingand not confuse them with more expensive choices. At mejuri we spend a lot of money for a product that wont give us the joy for long. You guys are the last hope. I walked away today saying your miscommunication cost me $500.

"Its not a great experience is it? When youre buying they always tell you all about the refund/exchange flexibility and warranties and wonderful perks wow what a respectable store youd think.And then lo and behold, they sell you a defective earring and you gift it to someone and they open it and try it on right in front of you and a group of people, only to realize the earring doesnt clip… What an embarrassing situation to be put in the first place, for something valued 650$+! Seriously…And of course when you go back right away to return it, they refuse! Suddenly theyre all about valuing quality and thoroughly checking their products. Where was this diligence when I was going home with the product? Where was the thoroughness and attention to detail then?Be very careful when youre shopping from this store.

I explained to the store manager that I simply tried the earrings for about 5 min before safely packing them away.

"Buyer beware:I bought a necklace and pendant for my wife recently at that store. She really loved it but unfortunately it was too small so about 2 weeks later she went to the store to exchange it for something else. She was very excited to do so as she really liked Mejuris products.To her shock, the store refused to take back the necklace arguing that it was not up to their required standard for a return. My wife explained that the necklace was only worn for about 5 minutes to try it on before she decided it was too small. There were no visible issues to us, no scratches or anything of that nature. The staff simply said they did a test and the necklace had lost its shine. We tried to explain that whatever issues they think there is with the necklace, it was sold to me in that same condition. No success. It was as if we were trying to explain to them that we are not trying to scam them or something. It was a humiliating experience.I contacted customer service online, explained the situation and sent them pictures of necklace. They agreed that it was in perfect condition and sent me a return label. I had to then go through the hassle of shipping it back myself and wait a couple of weeks for reimbursement.Unless you are buying something for yourself and know for certain that you will not in any scenario want to return the item, buy at your own risk because there is no guarantee the store will accept their product back even if it is in perfect condition.",,14.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Karim Haddad,Failed,,

"EDIT:Since writing this review, Mejuri has really made a big effort to right a wrong which is very much appreciated. They were having inventory issues and couldnt send me the backings. They sent me the piece I was missing as soon as possible and even sent me a gift for the unfortunate inconvenience I had went through.—————————————-I got a piercing during the opening weekend at the Montreal store back in January. I was told that I was going to get another follow-up appointment 2 months later to resize the flat back stud once the swelling went down.It seems they only had a piercer for the opening weekend because they no longer have a piercer to do the follow up appointment that was included with my purchase. I have called and I have visited the store and each time they say they are really close to hiring a piercer professional and that they cant give me the resized flat back stud because only a professional can handle it since it must be sanitized. I had left my contact information with them saying that they would reach out to me as soon as a piercer was available but, never heard back.I finally decided to contact the Custom Happiness Team and they said they would follow up with me and that I can always set up an appointment at their Toronto location. Another two weeks pass by and still no resolution. Unless the travel expenses would also be included in my follow-up appointment in Toronto, I am getting the sense that I am being placated time and time again without them actively trying to resolve their mistake.I find this highly irresponsible that Mejuri would offer a service for their opening weekend without making sure their clients would have the proper aftercare.",,2.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,4,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Marilina Cianci,Failed,,

"Mejuri is a hit or miss - I love all my rings and bracelet, but beware of earrings. I have different sizes of hoops and they have the worst clasps. Bought, along with my mother the Pavé Medium Hoops for my birthday and after wearing them twice, lost one on my third wear!! When trying them on in store, I had asked the sales rep regarding the clasp, but she said it was fine, that sometimes you need to clip it harder. Half of $600+tx down the drain. Heartbroken.Edited:As a customer who had raised the issue with the sales representative, who assured me there was no issue with the earring, Mejuri still blames me for the loss of the earring. Train your employees better. Craft your jewelry better. Very disappointed with the service.Also avoid the piercing studio! I have 12 piercings, 2 from here and both have gotten infected. The piercer also didnt have the proper equipment, so had trouble aligning the needle with the piercing, which resulting in playing around to get it to fit until I couldnt take the pain anymore and we decided to repierce the hole.",,14.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Charlotte Keogh,Failed,,

"Following the review of opening hours on Google, On January 4, 2025 my friend and I showed up at Mejuri on Stanley at 10:00 am only to end up hitting our noses on the door. The (male) employee inside was waving at us to leave but we didnt really understand why. So we stayed in front of the door until an employee finally decided to come see us to explain that the store finally opened at 11:00. A company of the size of Mejuri should have the correct opening hours on the sites visited by their customers. Very disappointing. In addition, several other customers bumped their noses like us.",,1.0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Julie Synnott,Failed,,

Her tone and attitude were condescending, and she didnt even try to pretend to help.

"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS.They attempted to host an exclusive event for M+ members on Nov 10,2024 at Yorkdale and failed the set capacity limits on the number of people who could rsvp to the event. We showed up at our designated time slot only to find hundreds of people lined up on a first come first serve basis.There was no order to the chaos.We were given mixed information but several different employees. One blonde girl only knew how to apologize she didnt really provide any help or answer questions. Another asian girl with blonde hair said someone would come through the line to take orders for people who knew what they wanted. And that did not happen. By the time someone else said there was a separate line to order outside the store that was after 1.5 hours of already waiting in the line. There were people making returns and ordering things online for pick up despite this being an after hours event. The mall closed at 7pm why are they taking regular transactions at the time of this special event. People were see skipping and hopping in and out of line.The girl (who said she was new she started in July) manning the line could not get through the entire line in over 2.5 hours because she kept on checking some peoples tickets then running back into then came out minutes later just to check a few more people and would continuously forget where she left off. If she just kept going through the line a lot of misinformation would not have been spread around and it would have made her available sooner to help people check out. She also did not actually check everyones ticket either some people around us didnt get checked. Once your ticket was verified there was no way to confirm that at the door, not that they were checking. So people hopped in and out of line after she checked that part of the line. Then after she was eventually done checking the line after 2hrs and 45 min, she didnt contribute to helping any other customers she just chatted with people in line. She also had the good sense to bring out 3 drinks for 3 people when there was still 2 dozen people who hadnt had any drinks. So not really sure why she was put in charge of manning the line she did an extremely poor job of it.They eventually started handing out drinks to the customers in line 2 hours into the wait and then the people at the end of the line had to wait 45 minutes to get their drinks because the person handing out drinks needed a break supposedly. I wasnt aware that handing out drinks required a specific skill set they were non alcoholic.The manager refused to come out to address any customers and said he had no power to do anything. There was no apology or consideration at all and definitely no customer service experience at all. So Im not sure what your purpose is if youre a manager of a store and cant fix any customer issues or make any helpful decisions.I had a 7pm time slot and i saw people who had later time slots than me at 730 and 8 get helped and get items before me.Do not be fooled by Mejuri and their shiny objects, they have no common sense, no customer service experience, no competence. Especially at Yorkdale as well which is supposed to represent a client focused luxury experience mall.The photo attached does not show the line that went towards mac cosmetics to banana republic and then back and down all the way to babaton. You can see there is just a mass amount of people standing around the front of the store as well with no line organization or employees to organize these people which also created a safety hazard since the store is really not that big either.The event was supposed to be from 7-9 and i selected a 7pm time slot and after waiting over 2.5 hours I walked away without going into the store and a lot of disappointment.As someone who has spent quite a bit of money at Mejuri and who advocates for small businesses especially local to Toronto I am very disappointed by entire experience and will not be a returning customer.",North York,1.0,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Tiffany Cheung,Failed,,

If these rings were scratched then I received them that way. I had them on for all of 5 minutes. They were so thin they looked like thread around my finger. As for the string with a tiny label on it, this company can simply put another on and all is good. I have spent many dollars at this store and have never had a problem, however this has done me in.

"1/5  Stars - Disappointing Experience with Mejuri Im writing this review as a cautionary tale for others. In July, I visited the Mejuri store in Yorkdale Mall, Toronto, to purchase a wedding ring set. I tried on several styles and ended up buying a wish bone ring set for around $600 after tax. The sales associate assured me that my ring size was 6, and I trusted that the rings I received were the correct size. However, when I opened the box on my wedding day, I was shocked to find that the rings were too big. To make matters worse, the customer service experience was appalling. I sent emails and received responses from at least 4-5 different people, including one who even got my name wrong! They eventually offered to let me return the rings for store credit, but we werent comfortable sending the rings back by mail and dealing with the uncertainty of the process. We took the rings to our local jeweler, who confirmed that the rings were actually a 7.5 - almost 2 sizes bigger than my correct size. Now were out of pocket for resizing the rings. But the final straw was when our jeweler called to inform us that during the cleaning process, ALL OF THE DIAMONDS fell out of the rings! Were talking about a supposedly high-quality piece of jewelry from a trendy brand, and it cant even hold its stones in place. Its unconscionable. Im extremely disappointed in Mejuris quality control and customer service. What should have been a special and memorable experience turned into a frustrating and costly ordeal. I would not recommend Mejuri to anyone.",North York,1.0,10/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Van Lam,Failed,,
I have been in your store  numerous times and made some purchases  but I think Im done.As much as I like your jewelry the attitude from  your sales staff who are not considered minorities in this country is not pleasant They act as if they are doing you a favor when you ask questions.

"Disappointing experience with purchasing jewelry from Mejuri. My excitement quickly turned into disappointment as the items I purchased failed to meet even the most basic expectations.The overall quality of the jewelry was shockingly low. We pay this amount of money and expect to have a good quality Jewelry, or at least normal quality that we can wear them couple of times, but no! I didnt even wear the ring ONCE!! and now I cannot return it because it passed the 30 days. Color changing exactly happened to my necklace as well after wearing it once and I naively thought it cannot happen to my other purchases since it is too disappointing for this brand and this price. The pieces seemed more like costume jewelry than the elegant accessories I had hoped for. I use my other jewelry bought from inexpensive brands every day and this didnt happen to them!Im so furious that I couldnt wear the ring even once!

"Edit:The social media team was much more responsive and helpful. They sent me a new pair of earrings and finally rectified the situation after two years. If you have an issue with the quality of the item you bought, I suggest you reach out to their social media team instead.Save your money and do not shop here! Their customer service is TERRIBLE!!! I spent $1,800 on my first visit at Mejuri. One of the earrings I was sold was faulty - the clasp on the hoop earring kept coming undone while I was wearing it. As a result, one of the earrings fell down the drain. When I contacted customer service, they said there was nothing they could do about it since the earring was lost. This logic is flawed because had the earring not been lost DUE to it being faulty, then they would have replaced the earring?

"I drove from London to this store today so that I could try on a list of rings I had. I am an active Mejuri customer and was willing to spend a considerable amount of money here, as this was a gift for my 10 year wedding anniversary. The store itself is truly beautiful, and the first person who helped us out was very friendly (the second person was not). However, only two of the 6 rings I had come to try were available to try on in the store. For one of the rings, the employee couldnt even find it, nor had heard of it. I pulled it up on the website to show her and she basically just said that it must be discontinued 🤷‍♀️ Now, this wouldnt have been too much of an issue if I hadnt tried all week leading up to this visit (almost 3 hrs drive) to call the store to check if they had the rings I wanted to try on. No one ever answered, and I also left a voicemail requesting a callback. I had a completely wasted trip to this store all because no one would answer the phone. 6 hours round trip I will never get back. If you live nearby, sure, go visit this store because its pretty.

Everyone seems pretty done with their lives and didnt really pay me any mind. The associate I dealt with did the absolute bare minimum to look for a size for me and help me with my request. She made me feel a bit uncomfortable and I felt a bit pressured into buying the product. She even handed me the phone to do her job which is asking me basic details that were already in the system. I got what I wanted but since I know my size I would just go online from now on, with the retail front not being very helpful and a bit cold. For such a brand that is all about diversity and positivity, there was a great lack of it on the retail front. I hope they improve their overall customer service experience in the future! :)EDIT:The jewelry tarnishes so fast! I bought a pair of sterling silver earrings and didnt put them away ""properly"", which is just sitting in a drawer, and they tarnished so badly! What a waste of my money.

I was looking at some mens jewelry and the person helping did not even crack a smile and gave very little information about the design and if there were any other similar options. Aside from the final associate handing me the necklace, the other people working there didnt even acknowledge me or make eye contact, while they kept welcoming and saying goodbye to other guests enthusiastically.When I went back to talk to the initial associate behind the counter to compare the necklace I bought, I was ignored while she helped 2 couples that came after me, until I interjected and said I would like some help. After waiting about 15mins, I finally got some help. Overall, a very isolating and negative buying experience in-person, Id probably just stick to the website and have it shipped. Horrible, horrible customer service experience, and it makes sense that they are mostly an online retailer.",North York,8.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Amil De Silva,Failed,,
"Delighted to see the store inside yorkdale. Ive seen so much advertisement and wanted to see what they had to offer. Immediately felt uncomfortable as EVERY SINGLE sales associate, supervisor, keyholder or manager if they had any on their phone. I mean I did a walk around to see what products were displayed, my mother wanted to try one of the piece. I felt repelled to ask anyone to see if we could try them on. I walked up to them and asked anyways. The lady looked up and said Everything is sanitized after each use, so just try (But there were other customers who were trying and putting the items back where it was found without being cleaned..?) than proceeded to do whatever she was doing on her phone. We walked out. I guess it was just all hype? I wouldnt recommend. Save your time and go to real brands like Cartier.

"Edit:Their team reached out over email and made great effort to invite me back and fix the situation. Changing to 3 stars.New to the Mejuri brand and I love a lot of the mens jewelry designs. But hoping corporate sees this review so the company can improve its customer service experience from online to in store:Whats the point of having your customers book an online styling appointment, fill in information on the specifics they need help with and the specific items they want to see, then to show up at your appointment and the staff in store have no information about anything you wrote down?It kinda kills the point of even having an online appointment system. When it comes to luxury goods like jewelry, the experience of purchasing the item is just as important as the item itself.I came in on time for my appointment expecting to see a few specific items (and wanted to buy them if they looked just as good IRL as online). Then I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes while the employee went back and forth to the back of the store telling me ""oh we cant find this, we cant find that. I can only bring you one item a time,"" then proceed to not talk to me at all while Im trying things on when she finally ends up finding the items (back room need better organization?). I ended up leaving before I even saw all the items I wanted cuz it was comical how bad the customer service experience was lol.Maybe the employees dont get commission so they dont care as much. Im not expecting a Chanel or Van Cleef level of customer service, but at least something on par with Apples organizational system where info is actually passed along would be great.",North York,3.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,3,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Rob Woe,Failed,,

"I never write reviews because theyre a waste of time. But Ive never been this upset with retail before. Bought a bracelet as a gift for a friend and it broke after one day. Wanted a refund because it was clear the design of the bracelet was the cause. Mejuri Yorkdale would not accept a refund and said I have to exchange it for the same bracelet when I know it will break again. I had to fight to get it exchanged for a different design and they also made it final sale. Why would someone want the same item if it broke after one day. Also, the manager at the Yorkdale mall who claims she has a lot of experience in the jewelry industry even went as far as blaming my friend for wearing it to sleep (bracelet broke overnight and was found next morning in bed). Blaming their customer is one of the most unprofessional things you can do in retail. The bracelet shouldnt be this bad quality to break after one night anyway.

"1 star is generous for this business.During Black Friday, my husband purchased two pairs of earrings for me.

When I contacted Mejuri, they claimed one pair was ""scratched"" and unsellable, attaching a photo as evidence (2nd photo). However, their original return email made no mention of any scratch issue.

"It was my first time visiting a Mejuri store. On August 23rd, 2024, I purchased a stud as a gift for a friend and booked a piercing appointment for August 25th. However, when my friend and I arrived on Sunday, we were informed that my appointment was not in the piercers calendar. Thankfully, I had taken a screenshot of the booking confirmation, which eventually allowed us to secure the 4:40 pm slot.Unfortunately, this situation led to a heated conversation with the piercer, Ella, who was quite rude to both my friend and me. During our conversation, I had to address her passive aggressiveness. Even when I spoke with the store manager, Ella continued to continuously interrupt us, adding to the frustration. This entire experience left a very bitter taste, and I ultimately decided not to go through with the piercing.Given how things transpired, I am considering returning the piece of jewelry I purchased and am hesitant to visit the Ossington store again.I hope this feedback helps improve future customer experiences and ensures that situations like this do not happen.",Toronto,2.0,9/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Alisha Singh,Failed,,

"I had two frustrating visits to Mejuri this week that left me highly disappointed. On my first visit, I witnessed an elderly woman struggling to enter the store with a walker while three sales associates stood nearby chatting without offering any assistance. As for my own experience, I called ahead to check if a bracelet was in stock and was told it would be held for me (was told the hold was approved by a manager and the sales associate took down my information). However, when I came in later that day, I was informed that the bracelet had been sold despite the prior agreement, and no effort was made to help me resolve the issue.A few days later, I called again to inquire about another item. After some back and forth, I was told they might have it in stock. When I asked to confirm the sales associate told me I can look if you want but it will take a while - If I am coming into the store I want to make sure the item is in stock. I was told they couldnt hold it for me, despite a prior associate having told me they can hold an item for me just days earlier. I also inquired about engraving a ring (was told the machine was down that day but would be running the following day).  When I arrived in store I was told machine was still broken—something I was never informed of by other stores, which had sent me to the Ossington location in the first place. The engraver has been down for months according to a sales associate.  The solution provided was that I keep checking back in the new year and hopefully it would be running.  This item was supposed to be a gift and now I will have to source and pay for the engraving.The communication between staff members was horrendous, and the lack of customer service was shocking.

I went into this store asking if there was something they could do about the clasp that came off a necklace I purchased from Mejuri, I understand the product was out of warranty but youd think for the price point the jewellery should last more than a couple of years.

The woman at the front counter shrugged it off and went back to what she was doing. If youre looking for good quality jewellery for a decent price point I recommend the nearby store Armed on Dundas.

"I would recommend to go find other places if you want to get ear piercing. Some professional piercing studio with reliable service quality. I should have done my research and read the review before getting my piercing done here.I had good experience back then when this store was located on Dundas st. and when they used to bring a local piercing parlour to their store and throw so called a piercing party. So I decided to try their piercing studio this time.On a day before my piercing appointment, I checked their website for available piercing jewelry. I didnt want anything too fancy, so I went for my appointment with $98 ones in my mind. On the day, basically I had only 5 choices, 2 of the options were $128 each, others like $300+. Ok, $30 x2 over the budget was find enough, so whatever.When the time for my check up appointment approached, it got cancelled, rescheduled, and cancelled again. This time, they apparently dont have a piercer available.Will I go back for a new piercing? NEVER. Would I recommend to others? NEVER. Will I go back maybe for their jewelry?

"I will never shop at Mejuri again after dealing with the manager at this location.For Christmas, my mother got me a ring from this location but sadly it was slightly too small. When I went to exchange this ring, I brought all the receipt cards that my mom had been given, but they told me I couldnt exchange the ring.  The ring my mother bought was not associated with those order numbers.There was no record online as well that my mom bought this ring or that it was associated with her credit card.Long story short, after spending 2+ hours over the phone and in store trying to resolve this issue, we discovered that at the time my mom was checked out, she was checked out incorrectly for the wrong ring. We did not have the croissant ring (that ring has been discontinued), but was charged 98$ for it, and the ring we bought was the charlotte bold ring (128$).We were accused of stealing the ring multiple times even though their sales rep made a big mistake and admitted that that must have happened. Upon exchanging the ring we had the full packaging (bag and box and exchange/return tag) and all the receipt cards yet we were still accused by the sales rep and the manager.We were nice enough people to just pay the difference in price for the ring instead of arguing.

"Ive had some quality gripes with Mejuri lately- everything from my gold vermeil ring tarnishing while it was still relatively new, to my 14k diamond initial pendant literally snapping in half within 9 months of purchase. Unfortunately, they were not able to honour their product warranty, as they determined that what happened with my pendant was not a quality issue on their end. But I would have to contest that that was definitely not the case. Im sure its easy for companies to just blame things like this on wear and tear to refuse warranty, but for an expensive, 14K solid gold with diamonds piece, I REALLY expected better from Mejuri.Mejuri used to pride itself on being affordable, but youre better off searching for 14K solid gold pieces on Etsy from independent, reputable jewellers. A lot of their pieces are universal designs (i.e. croissant ring, beaded ring, paperclip necklace) so you just have to know how to search properly. This is the route Ive taken as of late and I havent had issues with any Etsy retailers.",Toronto,4.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Sesil T,Failed,,

They helped me select some stacking rings for myself and those earrings I had in mind for my daughter.The store is very well laid out and gorgeous.I took one ring home, one ring was delivered to my home in 2 days and I had them ship my daughters earrings to her home which took only 3 days.I am very happy with my in-store purchases and the service there as well and now that I have seen the merchandise, I will not hesitate to order on-line",Toronto,1.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Anna Sobrino,Failed,,

The venue is very spacious, and the staff was super friendly. Between me and you, the Chicago staff was chill AF compared to Vancouver.

Do not waste your money coming here. Gorjana stands by their pieces and when you are spending 100 dollars on jewlery pieces you expect them to last more than a few months. Ridiculous.

"I dont even know where to begin. A year ago I bought 2 pairs of gold and diamond earrings that totaled to over $1K. Within days the clasp on one loosened. Within 3 months they started to tarnish. Went in store to show them and received store credit so I bought 2 other pairs. Within 4 days the clasp bent on one of them and I almost lost it. I reached out at this point requesting a full refund although their policy only does store credit. I explained that if I have to respect their policy I expect them to respect my expectations that when I spend so much on earrings I want them to last. I went back and forth for months with different reps. You can only text or email, no phone calls and I dont live in Chicago, I am out of state. They initially denied the warranty completely. I continued to explain how the clasp on this expensive earring broke quicker than any of my cheap Amazon jewelry. Then they agreed to fully refund me once I sent the products back, which I did. Once they received my earrings they sent another email saying they changed their mind on the refund and I can only get store credit because the product was returned bent??? Yes exactly thats why I dont want it anymore, because your jewelry is so cheaply made it cant even last a week. I literally do not want anything to do with them anymore and do not want any of their crappy,  poor quality and overpriced jewelry.

"I recently had an unfortunate experience at this location. Last week, a friend and I visited to purchase some pieces we had been eyeing and participate in their early access sale, which was invite only. We visited this store as soon they opened because my friend was traveling later in the day, and wanted to take advantage of the sale before she left. Since there were no signs up about the early accesssale, we asked staff about it.Several staff (honestly, too many staff) repeatedly asked if we actually received the invitation. Despite the fact that we knew more about the sale than your own customer service, they repeatedly asked--seeming to question whether someone like my friend would have actually received it. It was extremely odd. Now this would have been fine, but for the fact that after asking again and again, they then said they couldnt help because the sale wasnt until 7pm and there was no way to provide us with access to the sale ahead of that time.If that was truly the case, I dont know why we would be asked again and again whether we actually received the email. My friend and I were also told that the store was understaffed and they would have difficulty assisting us at all.This was my first time in this store.

"Hubby and I got new rings for each other as Anniversary gifts a couple of years ago. He picked a really nice black one, I think it was called the Kent.

However, back in May of this year our Kia was taken by the self proclaimed ""Kia boys"" and his ring was in the arm rest (gym, weights etc). After filing a police report, we contacted Mejuri and explained the situation. We were politely told that although they were sorry for the circumstance, a lost ring isnt covered under the warranty. It only covers damages to rings that are still in possession. Mejuri also offered for us to look at some other rings they have in stock and quoted the discounts available at that time. Although we left that conversation ring less, CPD recovered our car by that evening AND the ring was still there.

"Worth the time and money.  I went into the West Loop location this past Saturday for the first time, and I am very happy with my experience with Jackie.  I made an appointment to get my ears pierced ahead of time and had a general idea of what jewelry I wanted to be pierced with.  They have a section in the back, by the piercing studio for you to select the allotted studs they use to pierce.  I am glad I arrived 20 min early.  It gave me enough time to double check if the jewelry online were the same and it was.  They dont have an option to tip, so I would recommend bringing cash.  ( I dont tip ppl for everything, however this qualifies it) I was lucky Jackie had a client that came early, because I had some concerns with a 40 yr old piercing my parents had done for me at 2 months old.  The old one was so high on my lobe and close to my head, and she took great time, patience and care to show me why she chose the location and exact position.  Needless to say, but I will, corp. needs to allot 45 min as standard amount of time.        This IS a lux experience, and the short window given to the piercer and client, puts a lot of stress on both parties involved.  Mejuri needs to know how lucky they are to have Jackie, and her professionalism that saved the day for the limited time we had.  As for the rest of the staff, everyone had a caring smile, even the lovely security guard.",Chicago,0.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,Tiffany Keorkunian,Failed,,
"I was super excited to go to Mejuri in person. Theres something about seeing things on hand from shopping online. I wanted to buy a birthday gift for my friend so I wanted to go in store and get a gift receipt. I went on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite busy. There were plenty of workers but none looked like they were willing to help. They stood in a corner chatting away or they were busy on their phone. The set up of the store was quite pretty. Rings on one side, necklaces on the other, and rings in the middle. I flagged down an employee who looked like she was willing to help. She was informative and I ended up making some purchase.

They answered my questions and helped me with my requests. Im so bad with names, so I forgot the name of the sales associate who mainly worked with me.In general, the quality of the jewelry speaks for itself and the pricing is super reasonable. I like to treat myself to dainty pieces or statement jewelry here and there and I like to gift pieces to my friends because I know the quality would be great.

"We purchased our wedding bands at this location. The bands themselves are great. Our shopping experience was an unending hassle.Our first visit seemed alright. The store had opened recently, so they had very low stock. They didnt have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes that we could try on. They did have bands of other materials in those sizes, and they helped us size our fingers. Then we bought bands in those sizes to be shipped directly to us—not ideal, but we hoped the sizes wed pegged in-store were correct. They reassured us that, if either of us needed to move to a different size, the exchange process would be a breeze.It was not. While one of our initial rings was a success, the other needed a new size. Returning to the store to exchange it kicked off a months-long comedy of errors. The clerks for this visit had trouble at every step—finding our order, processing an exchange, checking stock. After a very long wait, it was confirmed the store still did not have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes, so we would have to essentially place an online order again. To prevent having to return to the store again, they recommended we order the next two half sizes so both could be tried on, one kept and one returned. From there the clerks had immense trouble processing an exchange, at one point turning the iPad around to show it wasnt going through the way they were trying—was that supposed to prompt an, I see, Ill just keep an expensive ring that doesnt fit then? Finally, they seemed to have been able to process the exchange and set up the two rings to ship to us.Except:we received no email confirmation of the exchange or shipment. We had to call Mejuri corporate, who were able to track down our order. Apparently the clerks had associated this new part of the order with a completely new customer account. While Mejuri corporate was able to find this, as a result for every subsequent step of the process—tracking the two new rings, returning the one that did not fit, receiving a refund for that ring—required going through Mejuri customer service.As I noted, we are happy with our rings. And Mejuris customer service on the web/phone are very helpful and prompt. Thus my experience at this store would lead me to recommend that customers simply do all shopping at Mejuri.com rather than in a store, and/or that Mejuri do a better job setting up its physical stores by having adequate stock and preparing their clerks for more situations than the simplest of sales.",Skokie,0.0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,2,"4999 Old Orchard Shopping Ctr Suite B34, Skokie, IL, United States",IL,Andrew Rogers,Failed,,

"Interesting concept for a jewelry store. Unfortunately, it activated one of my pet peeves, which is not having prices on items when you go into a store. In lieu of that, there are iPads situated throughout, that you are supposed to use to look up the item to find the price. Wouldnt call this a high-end jewelry store, but had a range of low and mid price items. Very cute and modern and streamlined. If youre a minimalist, you would love this place.

"Buyer beware! This is a nice storefront with good branding, but dont let that fool you. Their products arent great quality, they do not adhere to their posted policies, and they have abysmal customer experience. I bought merchandise from them in late November, and exchanged for different styles a week later. During that exchange, my transaction was rung as store credit + purchase rather than refund + purchase, without informing me that this nullified my ability to receive a refund, were I to return these items. A week later, I returned these items and was refused my money back, even though all items were unworn, with tags, and had been purchased 7 days prior. They acknowledged their mistake and my compliance with their policy. But they feigned helplessness, stating that the system couldnt support them refunding my full purchase amount. Even with 2 weeks of escalations to their leadership team, they still refuse to do the right thing.It is so disappointing to have a business not act in the best interests of its customers and to be so dishonest and unethical in their transactions. Ive filed a complaint with the better business bureau and advise anyone dealing with them to exercise extreme caution.

"Ive been a loyal Mejuri customer for years and have always enjoyed everything Ive purchased. About a year ago, I bought a sterling silver bracelet that I loved. Unfortunately, the clasp broke shortly after, so I went to the store to exchange it under warranty. I also needed to exchange a ring I had purchased because it wasnt the right metal for me.While the store associate and manager were very helpful, they had a hard time processing both returns in the same transaction, which ended up taking nearly an hour. When the associate brought out the replacement bracelet, it was a different metal than the one I originally bought. She explained that the bracelet had been updated due to issues with the clasp and that this new version was more expensive, but I was getting it at the original price. When I expressed my preference for a refund, the manager informed me that it wasnt an option, which left me feeling a bit trapped. In the end, I accepted the outcome.Despite this, I continued ordering online and had a great experience with all my other purchases. On my birthday yesterday, I visited the store and, to my surprise, saw the bracelet I originally ordered right on the counter. I explained my situation to Megan, who was helping with purchasing a new chain necklace. She noticed an exchange on my account and suggested that I bring in the bracelet so they could help me get the one I initially wanted and paid for.Before heading back to the store, I decided to call and speak with the store manager, John. He briefly explained that their system sometimes loses order information and that without the original order, they couldnt assist me. Unfortunately, they also couldnt find the warranty exchange that the previous manager had processed a year ago.Im very disappointed after being a loyal customer for so long, and will be taking my business elsewhere.

"I love Mejuris timeless jewelry and had been a fan of their online store long before I knew they had a location in the Domain. As with any store in the Domain, parking can be a pain if you just need to run in for something during a busy time, but the store itself is a breath of fresh air. Its so fun to see the pieces all together in person. The store is very calming and the check out process is seamless.  I also really enjoy that their stylists walk you through whats in your bag after you check out. Like explaining that theres a travel bag and cleaning cloth under the foam, or telling you what the little black strip is for. Its little but it just shows that they care and gives you an idea of how to take care of your jewelry instead of just assuming that youd know. I love the Mejuri has a range, from vermeil to solid pieces, at a really fair price. The pieces that I enjoy from them are timeless but modern.

Got piercing done by Miranda a couple of days ago! I was super nervous but she put me at ease. Miranda was super personable and hilarious! She helped me style my full ear and gave my first cartilage piercing. It came out perfect with her placement suggestion! Cant wait to get another one.

"I went to return a pair of earrings today that I bought on the July 6th, not even past their policy. Ive never worn them or anything because I ended up finding a better pair from a different jeweler at the Domain. They accused of me scratching the earrings and only allowed me to return the pearl charms. I dont see how that was possible if they werent worn. This mustve meant that they sold me scratched earrings. Terrible service from the staff, where they chose to falsely accuse their customers. Ridiculous and will never return after that poor service.",Austin,2.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,Cecile Nguyen,Failed,,
My husband bought me a gold necklace from here for my bday about a month ago. Im a teacher (so is my hubby) and have a very sedimentary life. The clasp was always loose and the necklace kept falling off. It happened again and now I cant find it. Money down the drain. Im very upset about the quality of their jewelry and feel awful that my husband spent all this money for me not to have it A MONTH LATER.

She was very careful to avoid the cartilage and work with what she had, and they came out great! She was able to squeeze a third one in, and theyre done very evenly despite my cartilage level being different on each side. She was very professional and made sure I felt comfortable before piercing, as well as explaining each step so I knew when exactly she was piercing.

"A very interesting experience here last week, and hasnt been a positive representation of the company.Last week was getting coffee at Starbucks when two of the employees here were having a conversation.

The blond lady was present in store, but was not welcoming and had a smerk on her face. Possibly because she recognized me from Starbucks as she was asked to leave. I later found out that she was visiting from California and her name was Britney from my advisor.If Mejuri allows their upper management to talk to store staff this way, I will no long shop or recommend Mejuri. Unhappy people deserve jobs where they are not face to face with employees. Maybe she isnt face to face often, but a simple smile would change my experience in store.

"I should have read the reviews on more than one site. Apparently the clasps on the earrings dont hold. After wearing them to the car and into a store, my daughter realized one had fallen out. Since it was lost, they do not consider it a warranty issue and will not replace the one earring. She wore them twice. Your better off throwing 50 bucks out the window then buying their earrings. Now after the fact, Ive read numerous reviewers saying the same exact thing. Mejuri refuses to accept responsibility for faulty clasps. Also, I ordered 2 items for Christmas presents and they put them both in the same box. When I contacted them to ask for another box (gifts for 2 separate people), they said they were too busy to send another one out and that you have to select the gift option to get a box for each item.

There I was told that there was a terrible infection and I have to get really painful, emergency antibiotic shot I was also prescribed a course of antibiotics and I missed work because of all this.Terrible experience, 10 days of pain, antibiotics and doctors.

While they seem like a quality store, their jewelry needs to be cleaned constantly to be nice and isnt worth the investment in my opinion because most are not real gold/silver - just plated.

"I went to Mejuri for the first time after being a longtime fan, but I was sadly disappointed with my experience. Beyond the security guard, no other employee of the store greeted me. I cruised around the store for maybe a solid 25 minutes before someone even offered me assistance or to inform me of the try-on procedures in the store. Despite my interest in purchasing the diamond cluster ring, no one actually bothered to assist me despite me verbally expressing my desire to purchase the ring. Everyone continued to ignore me and to help other guests. It wasnt until about 5 minutes prior to my exit that one associate offered me assistance.It left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth for the brand. While my experience does not reflect the brand as a whole, it did tarnish my perception of it. Additionally, I hadnt shopped at Mejuri since before the pandemic. So, it was exciting to see the pieces I was interested in in-person for the first time. But upon my visit, I came to find that much of Mejuris designs have changed. The rings appear even thinner and more fragile and delicate than when I first started shopping from the band. Dimond, pearl, and gemstone accents are miniscule on the rings. They are significantly smaller than when I first started buying from the brand.I understand they may have altered the designs to keep the prices affordable during a time where gold is at an all-time high, but they seem to have compromised quality for price. However, Im not so sure how affordable Mejuri is to the average consumer anymore. Along with my interest in the ring, I was also interested in some diamond hoop earrings from the brand and while I was browsing online at other vendors, I found nearly the same hoop earrings available at almost half the price at Zales.Overall, it seems times have changed for Mejuri and Im not sure if I will continue to shop there. For others, I would recommend exploring other options before purchasing at Mejuri. You get what you pay for, but sometimes its better to make an investment in a longer lasting product.",Los Angeles,4.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,1,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,Nadia Elizondo,Failed,,

"Cute boutique with a friendly and helpful staff! Not your typical high-pressure-sales jewelry store experience, which I really appreciate. My only disappointment was that the pieces I went specifically to see (and buy) were out of stock at the Melrose location.

Otherwise, an enjoyable shopping experience--it was great to see all of Mejuris stunning pieces in person and to try them on.

"Im a huge fan of Mejuri and love that I can come here before making my final purchase decision. Though the website is great, you dont really know what the jewelry is going to look like on you until you try it on. Yknow what I mean?Everyone here is lovely, personable, kind, and helpful. They check in to make sure all your questions and needs are met, but they also dont hover and pressure you to buy something. Once you are ready to order, they will bring out an iPad and help you purchase it right then and there. Other than the showroom jewelry, they dont have jewelry in stock -- which means your order will arrive via mail. Just a heads up, in case you were hoping to get jewelry on the same day lol.Depending on how many people are already inside the store, you might have to wait a few min outside.

The store was extremely understaffed with only two women working the day the store opened after being closed for multiple days for Christmas. In response to another customers complaint posted on this thread about the wait time, the owner writes that Merjuri offers online shopping and in-store pickup— well, I was unaware that I would have to wait in a nearly hour-long line for IN-STORE PICKUP which should take 2 minutes. Its as if Merjuri purposely understaffs the store after the holidays to discourage customers from returning their jewelry or making exchanges.

"I had long awaited this review. I had been here last november and asked for a flat from a piercer that seemed very nervous, shaky, and didnt even let me get a flat in the end, I left with a helix, that was crooked and never healed.About a month or two ago I had gone back to the location addressing my concern due to the fact that my helix wasnt healing and to begin with its not even what I asked for from the beginning, Modey was my new piecer at Mejuri that day and took such an amazing job of me, she had instantly said yea this needs to be fixed let me see what I can do for you. She ended up being able to fix my piercing with what I ended up wanting, I was a little hesitant at first due to my last experience but then she had really reassured me of her work in the process. Anyways fast foward about a month or two, I am so happy with my piercing! Modey was by far one of the best piercers I have ever been to and I have at least 20 piercings by other people, my flat looks great! and it looks ontrack to get the post downsized soon and be done healing! thank you so much Modey!

I love the flat back and all the piercing options they have that. Youre talking about real gold and real gemstones. No more boring studs that leave you wishing you had something more sparkly. Once they were healed and the swelling went down, I was able to go back in and switch out the posts to something shorter for free! You can also opt for the $30 gold flat back vs titanium. To top off my already great experience, I recently lost the backing to an earring when I was taking off my motorcycle helmet. They again, gave me the new post for free!

"Im not one to leave bad reviews, unless I continue experiencing issues at a store I frequent. To be clear, I love Mejuri jewelry and have been a customer since before they had physical stores in Seattle. The issue here seems to be within customer service. Whenever I walk into this store, I always feel like their last priority. They greet everyone else and people who come in after me, and it seems like they avoid asking if I need help. I dont understand it. I worked at Nordstrom in fine jewelry and watches for over 5 years and give a lot of grace because I know that things can get chaotic. Considering the size of this store and the demand for product, it makes sense why they are always busy. This time I tried to make eye contact with one of the associates and they looked at me and then looked away, and greeted another customer that came into the store. I had errands to run so I didnt have makeup on nor did I have a ton of jewelry on, which is not usual for me. I dont want to make extreme assumptions so Ill let management take it from here.

"The store is beautiful, and it is really nice to see all of the items that they have online in person.However, I didnt have the best experience with the setup towards ear piercing. First, I asked to be contacted when they had a piercer lined up (which the staff said they would do), and was never emailed. Then I signed up for an appointment online, and it was canceled because the piercers schedule wasnt updated online. When I finally got to my appointment, I was told I couldnt get my ears pierced because of a possible keloid scarring issue I may have had on one of my previous piercings although I was willing to take the risk. This was fair, but I feel like this could have been a part of the terms & conditions form I had to sign. Also, the piercer didnt want to do 4 piercings although the website allows up to four in one appointment.

As we waited, the piercing negative energy in this place was unbearable. I cant really explain the feeling other than it felt like we didnt belong there and that we were a burden to be helped. Ive never wanted to leave a business so quickly. As I read other reviews it comforts me to know that this isnt just some figment of my imagination. This store I cant imagine will last long.

"I had a very bad experience in this Mejuri at W 4th in Vancouver, and Im still dealing with it years later.Two years ago, I got my wedding band at this store. A simple white gold band, with a letter engraved on the inside. Since then, two main problems came from it, leading me to spending a lot more to remedy the issue. Save yourself some trouble and dont buy there. They dont care about customer satisfaction.1. When it was sold to me, I tried different sizes to choose the right one and the customer service rep told me that I could always get it readjusted if the size wasnt right when I got it. When I got it, the size wasnt right so I went back to get it readjusted and they said that was not possible because of the engraving (no one had told me that before). I explained that at the store and they didnt care at all. So, I had to take it to another jeweler and pay extra to get the size adjusted in a rush before my wedding day.2. A few months later, the gold started to yellow and it didnt look like white gold anymore. I took it to the store and they said they couldnt do anything. I then took it to another jeweler and they explained to me that it wasnt fully white gold, but rather white gold plating with yellow gold underneath. This was not said to me when this store sold me the ring. So I had to pay for this other jeweler to re-plate it into white gold.After a few months, the same thing happened again, the gold started to yellow. I had moved away by that point so I took it to another jeweler in my new city and they told me the same, saying that every few months I would have to pay to have it re-plated if I wanted the ring to remain white because the ring was not made from white gold or a gold that could sustain that white gold/silver color I was looking for (and that was sold to me at the store).I would not have bought it if this store was honest about the products it sells; I wanted a white gold ring, and Im stuck with the wrong color.It wasnt cheap either.

"I recently visited this jewelry shop to purchase a bracelet and earrings. I brought two pictures of the items I was interested in and asked the female staff member to assist me in viewing them in person—one picture was of a bracelet, and the other was of a pair of earrings. However, the earrings she showed me were obviously different from the picture I provided. To make matters worse, the earrings I was asking about are one of their supposed bestsellers, so its baffling that she couldnt recognize them. The bracelet she showed me was also incorrect.When I proceeded to pay for the bracelet, I noticed that the price was different from what I was originally told. This means all the information she provided me was inaccurate. To add insult to injury, when I asked her for assistance in wearing the bracelet, she didnt even look at me or acknowledge me properly. She simply said, ""Okay, Im gonna help you,"" in a dismissive tone, unlocked the bracelet, and handed it to me. I struggled to put it on, and despite standing right next to me, she made no effort to assist.Its hard not to believe that she did this on purpose. Her terrible attitude and lack of professionalism made me feel completely unwelcome in the store. And seriously, how can a staff member not know their best-selling items?This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience Ive ever had. I will never return to this shop, and I strongly advise others to take their business elsewhere. There are plenty of other jewelry shops that offer better service, accurate information, and an overall pleasant shopping experience.

"I ordered some earrings online for black Friday to replace my old hoops. The old hoops completely snapped and pierced through my left ear, causing bleeding. I had asked in stores if Mejuri can replace the broken ones, and they said no. I still decided that with one good hoop from the previous pair left, it was worthy to give the brand another shot during their black friday sale. I went in to pick up my new earrings in stores last weekend - I spoke with a male employee with glasses to ask for help. It is difficult to describe this, but his tone of voice and expressions were rude, as if that I should not have been talking to him, or bothering him. I was told that I cannot pick up my order, because you need to present your photo ID, which I had no idea about. I asked if it would be okay to show them the order receipt and pick-up notification email instead as that is a proof of purchase. They said a cold ""No"", walked a couple of steps away from me, and left me standing at the counter… I looked at them helplessly as they stared at me in judgement and did not provide further customer service or assistance… I was quite taken aback and shocked at this treatment, but did not want to cause a scene and complain.. Moments after, I went to them and asked if I can speak to another staff member, and someone else came out from the back and handled the pick up thereafter.I find the unhelpful attitude and unprofessional initial encounter to be completely unnecessary. I hope the store can properly train their staff to provide bare minimum adequate customer service.Ive been a customer for the brand for quite some time, and going in stores to be treated in a disrespectful manner was very disappointing.",Vancouver,0.0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Ellen Jessica,Failed,,

"Edit:Mejuri reached back out to me to offer replacement of the defective cartilage hoop since it was still well within the warranty period.While I understand theyre not a luxury brand, their prices are by no means cheap, so Id expect better customer service from them. I purchased diamond hoops for my cartilage piercing a little over a year ago, which is still within their 2-year warranty period. The clasp on one of the cartilage hoops has been loose, falling off my ear a few times since Ive worn it. Understandably, I was concerned its only a matter of time before I lose it so I reached out to them for a replacement under their warranty which was rejected because apparently they expect me to remove my cartilage hoop everytime before I sleep and before each shower, which is impractical and not a common practice at all for jewelry meant for cartilage, helix, naval piercings. I have the exact same hoop on my other ear which has also been worn since I purchased it and has not fallen off, but they refuse to accept that this one may have been a bit loose from the start (a concern also raised by others in the reviews on the product, which I regret not paying heed to). Ive owned multiple different cartilage earrings over the past couple of decades and have never had this issue before. Please be mindful they dont offer repair for their jewelry which can be quite frustrating as a customer.",Vancouver,0.0,11/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,3,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Sudipti Katwal,Failed,,
"I just wanted to express how frustrated I am with Mejuri. My earrings clasp broke in my ear yesterday all of a sudden and Mejuri declined to change the piece as it was outside their 2 year warranty claim. The decision made is honestly outrageous and Im trying hard to understand how you qualify as a proper jeweller if youre unable to provide the below services:- Youre unable to REPAIR what you sell. This is literally in the description of a jeweller, it doesnt even have to be a luxury one as you claim you are.- Youre unable to buy gold which is the funniest thing. You cant even buy back the item that you already sold.- You refuse to renew the item.- Last of all, you dont even sell the earring in singles. The customer is required to buy the item again.I also want to mention that this clasp has been already broken twice and I had to change it in store. Its super flimsy and it really speaks for the quality of your so-called jewelery. Your gold pieces are obviously not cheap and one makes this purchase thinking it would be an heirloom piece, to be used for the years to come, at least I did. I was mistaken!

"1 star because I love the jewelry however the customer service could use some feedback.Upon requesting to purchase a set of earrings, the employee informed me they only had the single earrings in stock. I asked if I could purchase 2 singles for the price of a set as they did not have sets available in store or online. I was informed that they could not do this and as a result I feel this is poor customer service. To build customer clientele it would have been in their best interest to honour the price of a set.Secondly after purchasing a set online I lost one of the earrings which seems to be a common trend in the reviews. I realize this is a method of sales (so customers will purchase singles) however why not make the butterfly backings of good quality? Or perhaps offer alternative backings as well that tend to hold better.Generally speaking I do not find the service great here. It seems as though the employees are too busy chatting amongst themselves.EDIT:contacted customer support in regards to a bday discount code I received via email and accidentally deleted. Customer service via text is disturbingly not genuine (felt as if I was speaking to a robot). Could not provide me with discount code nor assist in any manner. Lack of professionalism.

"I had an excellent experience getting my lobes pierced in February (second holes). The piercing healed quickly and although it was expensive (minimum $75/earring+$25 piercing fee), I thought the quality of the earrings made it worth it. They pierce with threadless flat back earrings that are long to account for swelling and offer a free downsize after ~2 months after healing. When I was ready to downsize, I was notified that due to stock issues they did not have the shorter backs and it would be 2 weeks until they got them in. It has now been a month and I have still not been contacted about when they will be arriving. Once healed, the long backs get caught in everything and actually reopen the hole which is quite painful and can increase risk of infection. I finally have given up and bought my own short backs from a different company.  I also didnt realize the upgrade to the short backs is titanium not gold, so the cost of the earrings is really only for the very small front part of the earring. Im sure they will keep piercing and keep experiencing stock shortages forcing people to purchase their own backs or the Mejuri gold ones ($70) instead of the free downsize. After all of this, I dont think the cost of the earrings is worth it and the customer service I received has been pretty bad.",Vancouver,4.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Megan,Failed,,

Most of the pieces are for women but they do have a small selection for men.

my sister and I came here for the first time to get a bunch of ear piercings and from the start Sarah was so warm and energetic and made us feel super comfortable. She took the time to map out our ears and help us with deciding what would look best. We both left super happy and would 10/10 recommend going to get pierced by Sarah!!!

"I got two piercings done here two weeks ago. Their piercing jewelry selection is nice and priced fairly well, compared to other places. Im happy with one of my piercings, but the other one is pierced lower than where she put the dot. It looks asymmetrical compared to the other side, and even next to the piercing beside it. Annoying to have this happen when I spent over 500$. I dont want to get re-pierced so I guess I have to accept it",Vancouver,3.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,2,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Belinda Li,Failed,,

"I used to love buying from Mejuri online, and was very excited when this store opened so I could shop in person. As other reviews reflect, my experience when the store first opened was uncomfortable and chaotic. But! I thought Id give them another shot since theyve been open a year now.Same creepy and cold atmosphere. This is another cashless (so, classist) store. Want to know the price? A rep has to look it up on their website with an ipad. Want to buy? Take your credit card, enter allll the info in on their website manually (yes, were still at their physical store), and wait for someone to pack your order in the back. Why shop online when you can shop online while standing in the store? Staff have been cold both times Ive been here - Mejuris *empowement* and *accessible luxury* culture does not carry into the physical store.Spare your time, money, and good vibes and take your business to the other more longstanding jeweler on 4th.",Vancouver,8.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Tikvah Briscoe,Failed,,

"This is the first google review I have ever written. Something Ive only been compelled to do after my experience with Mejuri. If I could give Mejuri 0 stars I would. This review is not about this store, but rather Mejuris online store. If youre looking to purchase anything online from them, DO NOT. Its currently December 19th and I still have no idea where my item I purchased on November 22nd is. Its been almost a month and Ive missed my wedding anniversary. Ive reached out to Mejuri several times online but theve done little to nothing to resolve the issue. I even asked to have my order cancelled yesterday and be issued a refund which they said they cant do. When I originally purchased my order from their website, I did so with their shipping guidelines in mind, which clearly is not accurate. I strongly suggest looking elsewhere before buying anything online from Mejuri.

"Would give 0 stars if I could.I had a terrible experience at Mejuri. The sales associates were not attentive and they were extremely unfriendly. When you dont display prices, its expected that staff will be more engaging and provide you with all the product details —but that was not the case. I asked for prices of a few items, and the associate kept giving me rough estimates with annoyed expressions, as though I was wasting her time.When I asked for the price of a ring, she told me its around 50 and when I asked if that was before or after the discount, she simply told me, there is no discount on that, without asking how much I was planning to spend. The promotion was that you had spend over $150 to get discount. I had already set aside other items and would have easily qualified for the discount, but they didnt bother to offer any information and just assumed that i wont be getting a discount lolThe only friendly person with a smile was a guy who assisted me briefly, but even he kept walking away and disappearing in the back even as I was paying, which felt very unprofessional. It was clear that they werent interested in providing any kind of real service.I came in with intentions to buy multiple pieces, but after the poor customer service, I decided to leave with just one item—one I already knew the exact price of because I looked online.Jewelry stores used to offer a luxury experience, but at Mejuri, the associates attitudes reflect the same lack of quality Ive experienced with their jewelry.I wont be returning.",West Vancouver,3.0,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Sana Pierre,Failed,,

"The sales associate was not at all familiar with products and pricing and told me that there was nothing in my budget of up to $150.

Ive since looked up the bracelet online and see its a topaz gemstone and the bracelet goes for $98. I also see another bracelet for $118 that was right next to the topaz one in store, and yet he told me theres nothing in the store in my price range. Ive shopped at Majuri before and have certainly seen items within $150, but with his lack of help and smug comment to brush me off, he made me feel like I wasnt ""good enough"" to help since I clearly cant afford to shop there. What is now clear to me is his lack of any product knowledge and his immense unprofessionalism. If the products at Mejuri are priced as high as he says, then perhaps their sales associates should learn more about them and care for the customers purchasing these ""big ticket items"".

Good options between gold vermeil (plated) and solid gold. IMO it is worth the extra price for the solid gold, and their solid pieces are not too much more than the plated. Will return in future for more purchases :) My boyfriend also commented on their more masculine pieces, titanium bands etc., we will be back for sure :)",West Vancouver,0.0,4/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Bee Scott,Failed,,

"1st time I went to the store had to leave because they dont take cash. That was fine service was good and girl super attentive I let her know that I had a voucher and she didnt hesitate to apply to my order immediately. Second time I took my card to buy the same items and the girl was quite unpleasant. Lots of knowledge about the product but quite an attitude that felt uncomfortable. Told her about my voucher and she couldnt care less. Had to remind her about that after she typed my total on the card machine and she rushed me to get the code. Ended giving up looking for the voucher, just wanted to leave the store as quickly as possible. She wanted to make that sale so badly that forgot that an actual human was paying for the merchandise. Hope they hire better from now on. Shopping online for sure.",West Vancouver,1.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Ana Carolina Ribas,Failed,,
"I had a great experience at the Park Royal store. Even though it was packed with people, I had a sales person right away. You need one to find out the prices! She was patient and not pushy at all. I wanted to see the jewellery in person. Great prices.",West Vancouver,0.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Tamara Roberts,Failed,,
My go to store for jewelry. Beautiful dainty everyday pieces for reasonable prices compared to other jewelry stores. So glad they opened a location at park royal. Every time Ive gone into the store the sales associates are so helpful. They never pressure me into buying anything even if Im just browsing and taking my sweet time trying to make up my mind. Amazing customer service always!!,West Vancouver,0.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Reeti Soni,Failed,,
"Went in to pick up my an online order that I have already paid for. It took a while for them to take it out. As per the website, the jewelry bought will be beautiful wrapped, as I mentioned online, that it was a gift. It just came in the boxes and the linen bag (might be this stores definition of beautifully wrapped)Anyway, hungout for a while to see if I can purchase something more for myself. None of the staff were accommodating as the displays had no price tags. All the sales representatives were busy chatting or on the iPad looking at something. I was trying to get eye contact, but no one seemed interested to sell me anything. I just left the store very disappointed. Designs look cool, but customer service was very awful.",West Vancouver,0.0,5/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Bettina del Rosario,Failed,,

"I went to get my ears pierced and had a great experience. The staff were lovely and walked me through all the steps.
