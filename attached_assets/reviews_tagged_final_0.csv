"I recently visited Mejuri and had a great experience! The store has a wide selection of beautiful pieces. The sales associates were incredibly friendly and helpful, offering great advice and making sure I felt comfortable throughout my visit and with my purchases.What really stood out was the piercing studio experience with Dawn (their in house piecer). She was not only knowledgeable but also professional and patient. Dawn gave me personalized ear styling tips, helping me select the perfect placement and jewelry that would complement my other piercings. The piercing studio is very clean and Dawn took great care in ensuring everything was sterile throughout the entire process. She used all the necessary precautions and followed a strict protocol to maintain a clean and safe environment, which made me feel even more confident in her expertise.Overall, I highly recommend Mejuri for both their beautiful jewelry and exceptional piercing experience. Its clear that they take great care in providing a top-notch customer experience!

"Beware, this mostly online retailer has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. I purchased a pair of their earrings that I later wished I had returned as they were far to too heavy to be comfortable to wear. I tried to post an honest review on their site which strangely never appeared after multiple attempts, making me doubt the validity of their customer product reviews. If you purchase any of their products, I would first visit the store and view in person, rather than going by the reviews. I would also  be sure to save all of the packaging materials in case you are not completely satisfied with the product (which may be likely). Mejuri has not responded on why the website did not accept my review, but did tell me they pass along my product feedback.",Boston,0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Carolyn Cerva,"{'Online Shopping Experience': ['online retailer', 'website'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['too heavy', 'uncomfortable'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['not responded', 'never appeared'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['packaging materials', 'return'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['view in person'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['not satisfied']}",Online Shopping Experience | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Communication & Policy Consistency | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Store Organization & Product Selection | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,online retailer | website | too heavy | uncomfortable | not responded | never appeared | packaging materials | return | view in person | not satisfied

"I came in to buy some hoops and the person who helped me made me feel very unwelcome. She didnt greet me at all and whenever I asked a question, gave me very short answers which made me feel very rushed. She seemed annoyed the entire time I was there.

"Came in for an EXCHANGE for a gift worth $100, or for store credit. Went through 3 people in order to find someone who could help me do the exchange (everyone was too busy and told me to wait, which was fine). What was not fine was, finally, when they were helping me, the person REFUNDED to the original payment instead of store credit for an exchange. He even asked me refund to original? with his finger hovering the button, and before I could say NO he pressed it. And then, he told he couldnt undo the refund and told me to ask the original gifter (who is long gone to another country, btw - also do you know how awkward that is??).

Im going to make this VERY clear that I work within the retail sector and have been for 10+ years, WITH experience in jewelry, so I know what great CX is supposed to look like.Firstly, I was made to feel like I wasnt wanted in the store. I came in with high intent to purchase (and I did), but not a single associate greeted me, or asked me for help as I was visibly browsing. I had to flag an employee to discuss the earring selection.She was ""kind"", but was also speaking to me as if I couldnt afford a $500.00 pair of solid gold hoops? Very insulting, because it wasnt once, it was multiple times I was spoken to in a condescending manner about price range.

"I would not recommend Mejuri wedding bands.Goodbye Mejuri, it was nice while it lasted.Id bought rings at Mejuri before (Spring St location- they were lovely) and figured it would be a good place to get my wedding bands. I went to the Williamsburg location, where they didnt have the sizes we needed in stock, so we had them shipped to our home. The first red flag here is that we were told a signature would be required for delivery, but the rings were just left in our lobby. Glad I worked from home that day so I could pick them up quickly, but the package could have easily been stolen.After trying the ring on for a little longer, my partner realized that he needed a smaller size. My office is a block away from the Flatiron Mejuri location, so we stopped in around lunch on a weekday, in the hopes we could do a quick exchange. Everyone on the floor was busy when we walked in, so we posted up by the wedding bands to wait for somebody to be free.We waited for at least 10 minutes without as much as a hello. I made eye contact with a salesperson and she, seeming surprised, asked oh, do you need assistance?. Oof, second red flag. Maam, maybe I do look poor, but I thought we were living in a post-Pretty-Woman society, where I was allowed to shop while frumpy.I asked if we could exchange my partners ring for a smaller size, and possibly mine for a thinner one. The vibe was icy and skeptical. The rings were taken back and reviewed-- mine had multiple scratches and could not be exchanged. Fair, whatever. My partners had one small scratch and could not be exchanged. What? They admitted that it might have just been sold to us that way, but we would have to return to the Williamsburg location and try our luck there.Maybe its just because Im in my thirties now, but I truly want to get serious about my jewelry, which means having a relationship with a jeweler I feel comfortable with and who can back up their pieces or like... resize them at least. Mejuri is not that. Come here for a cute trendy piece (and dress the part if you dont want to be ignored).

"Horrible Experience at this location. When I asked to check if the earring placements are ok, he was extremely curt and didnt want to show me which areas I can place the earring on.I have previously gotten pierced at Maria Tash and the experience was much better.Here the piercer didnt show me if the needles are sterilized, if the jewelry is sterilized and he was clearly annoyed when I asked to move the placement.This type of service for piercing is unacceptable. If the appointments are 20 mins only, they should tell people to show up early to select jewelry. Piercing is a permanent modification. Rushing someone through it is extremely unprofessional and makes the customer feel really unhappy. I literally walked away feeling that I was shooed away.Also to add, I got my cartilage piercing first and got my lobe done after, and idk what happened but he applied so much force on the lobe one it was hurting a lot. This is my 5th piercing and Ive never had anyone push the needle in with so much force on the lobe piercing.Honestly I was extremely unhappy with how the appointment went.So not recommended at all, please book somewhere else.",New York,0,11/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,Shalini Vijay,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['horrible experience', 'extremely curt', 'clearly annoyed', 'rushing', 'shooed away'], 'Professional Piercing Services & Environment': ['earring placements', 'needles sterilized', 'jewelry sterilized', 'permanent modification'], 'Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality': ['much force', 'hurting', 'lobe piercing'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['20 mins', 'show up early', 'select jewelry']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Professional Piercing Services & Environment | Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality | Communication & Policy Consistency,horrible experience | extremely curt | clearly annoyed | rushing | shooed away | earring placements | needles sterilized | jewelry sterilized | permanent modification | much force | hurting | lobe piercing | 20 mins | show up early | select jewelry

"Avoid. If you dont avoid... only buy in the store, and only buy something you know you will absolutely not need to return.They sent me earrings that apparently had tiny scratches on them that were not visible to the naked eye. I took them out of their bag only to try them on, realize I didnt like them (they were so heavy that they were stretching out my ear holes and it was uncomfortable) and I put them right back in the bag.  When I tried to return them, THIS is apparently when the earrings were thoroughly inspected with a microscope. (Not before I purchased them.) They did not accept the return because of scratches, which I know with 100% certainty I did not cause. I also could not see any scratches on the earrings when the associate in the store was trying to show me.

"This is the first review Ive ever left online, but I was truly disappointed with my experience today. Went by the Soho location this evening, to pick up an order that Id purchased online during the Black Friday sale. I specifically chose to pick up in store so that I could discuss styling options with the staff - I really hoped for some suggestions on curating a pretty ""earring stack"", something Mejuri advertises all over its website and social media. I spent $1200 on 14k gold pieces, (which is a big investment for me) and even intended to grab a few more items during my visit. Most of the staff members were friendly, and the store itself was aesthetically quite pleasing, which is why Im leaving 2 stars instead of 1. That said, the piercer on duty was honestly really, really rude. Each time I asked him for his insight, he would very flatly respond with something along the lines of ""its all personal preference"", and his tone, body language, and facial expressions all came across as condescending and judgmental, like he thought I was a waste of his time, as well as an idiot for not knowing exactly what I wanted and where.

"DO NOT GET PIERCED HERE.I usually go to tattoo/piercing parlors but got a tragus piercing here because my sister wanted to get something done together. I completely regret coming here because now I have an infected tragus piercing.One, I dont think mejuri focuses on the actual healing process of a piercing (focuses on aesthetic instead) and doesnt do well with informing the client what can/cant be done. Ive gotten several cartilage piercings before and the piercer inserted a bar thats WAY too short for my tragus (left no room for swelling/healing). Because of this, my piercing has consistently been infected and has a keloid despite how much I clean it and avoid laying on it.Not only that, but I found the piercers provided basically no after care besides some QR pamphlet...which I found embarrassing. I cant imagine if youre someone who has no experience with piercings and your piercer doesnt even educate you on after-care. Luckily I have experience with piercings so I know the protocol; but every other piercer Ive been at has always done a through aftercare with the client letting them know what to do. Also, usually they have saline solution you can purchase to clean the piercing (mejuri does not offer that...and I consider that pretty standard for a piercer to have on hand for clients).Maybe if youre only buying jewelry, come here.Otherwise youll just leave with an infected ear and to be out $200-$300.

He took time with me for a mini consultation and was very patient as I had to reorganize my thoughts and decide on what I wanted given I was unable to achieve the style I originally booked the appointment for. He was very kind and very professional. He made my experience so enjoyable and I will definitely return for future piercings. In addition, I purchased a bracelet which I scouted out on the website prior to coming in-store. The sales associates were nice and attentive. My shopping experience was great.

"I used to shop at the Mejuri SOHO store pre-pandemic, and the service used to be fabulous!Ever since the pandemic, the level of service seems to go down a bit more every time I returned. I visited the SOHO store today 8/24/2023 at around 2:30pm. At the time, there were less than a total of 10 people in the store. I was browsing the 14k solid gold counter, where a sales associate was positioned, she was at the time not servicing other customers.For the 2-3 min while I walked around the counter, clearly interested in making a purchase, not only did she not budge from her spot at the counter, she had ZERO intentions to even drop a simple ""hello"" or ""welcome"".When I used to come to the store, the sales associate would help to sanitize the pieces that I wanted to try, so when I asked where I can find the sanitizing swabs, she made a snarky comment and said ""theyre all cleaned."" I wasnt about to take her word for it, so then I asked politely where I could get some swabs to do it myself. She pointed ""somewhere"" to the middle of the counter and said, its all in there. It took me a good 5 seconds to see and realize that she was pointing to a covered marble cup holder in the middle of the counter, but she couldnt be bothered to even help me grab it or to even clearly indicate what she was referring to.I also asked her about the product that I was looking for. After telling me that they didnt have it in stock, I asked her for something comparable, where she then answered ""Im not sure whats the most similar piece."" I tried the product and despite liking it, I wanted to leave and order online so that I didnt have to deal with the unacceptable level of customer service that I received.The irony of this whole experience was that, as I was leaving the store, the security guard at the front of the door said to me ""have a nice day!"" I honestly think the security guard wouldve been a more fit salesperson and the associates actually working there.As a fellow Canadian, I love supporting domestic brands. But between competitor brands like Kinn Studio, Aurate, Catbird and others, the level of service is just inexcusable.Will also be sending a review to your media accounts.",New York,7,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Helen T.,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['zero intentions', 'snarky comment', 'unacceptable level', 'inexcusable'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['not budge', 'couldnt bothered'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['didnt stock', 'browsing counter'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['sanitizing swabs', 'try product'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['service fabulous', 'security guard'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['order online']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Organization & Product Selection | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Online Shopping Experience,zero intentions | snarky comment | unacceptable level | inexcusable | not budge | couldnt bothered | didnt stock | browsing counter | sanitizing swabs | try product | service fabulous | security guard | order online

"Mejuri markets itself as high quality for lower prices.Cons:(1) Images online are NOT always reflective of the piece in-person -- for example, a necklace I ordered had a lobster clasp in its online product photo, but when I received it it was a spring ring (lobster clasps are better and easier to use)(2) they are a good value if you compare them to a luxury designer like Tiffany or Cartier obviously, but they are notably more expensive per gold weight than their actual peer competitors like Quince.(3) They are a retail store more than a jewelry store, as in they dont have jewelers in-store or repair any of their pieces. Which is fine, but their employees can only provide very basic jewelry guidance.(4) Customer service is mixed. I ordered an item on 11/28/22 which made it eligible for the 60-day holiday return policy (normally its 30 days), although it was backordered, and then further delayed so I only received it in the mail on 2/9/23. I went in-store to return it only 2 weeks later after receiving it, however the employee gave me a hard time insisting that it was beyond the 30 day window and that she would ask the manager for a one-time exception. However, its returnable for 60 days (normally 30 days) from the date of delivery (confirmed with customer service online). I tried to explain this but employee was reeaally insistent and was acting like she was doing me a huge favor by making a one-time exceptionPros:(1) Their social media customer service seems pretty decent. They quickly clarified their 60-day holiday return policy and that it begins from the date of receiving the item.(2) In-store you can just grab and try-on whatever items, so you can try on basically all their store items pretty quickly (vs. requiring an employee to let you try one item on at a time which takes forever). Lots of seating for the waiting boyfriends/shopping partners too.I have no experience regarding their warranty.

"I have been buying from Mejuri for a few years now and really like their jewelry.That said, I recently made my first couple visits to the store and have been disappointed with the experience around order pick-up.

At my second, I waited 15 minutes, and 2 different people who I watched check in after me had their names called first. I also saw someone decide to buy a new item, pay for it, and get it packaged up all in the span of time that I waited. In both cases I was just buying a single necklace, nothing complicated. My expectation around pickup is that, since I got an email saying my order was ""ready"", it should be all packaged up and ready to go and handing it off to me should just be a matter of grabbing the right bag and not take 15-20 minutes each time.

"TLDR:Poor service. Spend your money where you are treated with respect.Context:I visited the Mejuri store on Spring St. to purchase two items. When I entered I immediately asked for the pieces I wanted to purchase, a pair of sterling silver earrings and an ear cuff, to try on. As I tried on the items, I asked a question regarding the dullness of the pieces and if polishing them would help them appear shiner. The associate was unsure and provided a piss-poor response making no attempt to seek assistance from a more knowledgeable staff member or her manager. As I continued trying on the pieces, I overheard the the associate and her co-worker talking about me, not to mention the associate who was supposed to be helping me and instead was commenting on my weird question, did so in a mirror that I could see and easily read her lips in (genius, she is not!)After overhearing the conversation I put the items down and started to leave. However, as I was still upset, I returned to the store and complained to the manager. The manager was apologetic of course, but honestly, how am I expected to believe anything coming from her if your employee is so emboldened to talk about the customer theyre serving the middle of a transaction. To me, this speaks to the culture of the store and tells me that this is acceptable behavior. I have worked in several customer-facing roles, retail and otherwise, and would never had dreamed of talking about a customer in their face unless I thought this was acceptable practice. Without a shred of doubt, I can tell you I would never shop at this location again.If you do venture into this location, avoid the associate who helped me at all cost.

Not only is this beyond frustrating to now have to search for a gift super last minute when I work until Christmas even 8pm… I attempt to purchase another item instead (costs twice as much but its fine because its worth it).I ask for assistance in getting the expedited shipping (cost $15 but its ok bc again its worth it) and they tell me I cannot. It was an option for me to click on but I wasnt able to go back to fix it after that order was processed.They basically try to shut me up and tell me theyll give me $20 credit to my account (my order cost $550.)

"I have been obsessed with Mejuri since the brand first hit the scene, and even more since they opened their doors! Usually when I visit I am greeted with bubbly faces and kindness, however, this past weekend (Saturday), I had a completely different experience.

I have visited the store a couple of times now and have come familiar with the associates there, but this time around the manager who I was dealing with couldnt give me more than 2 seconds of her time. Within 2 minutes of our time together, she left me and the questions I had hanging and assisted another woman who walked in after me.

"This one star review is specially for their VERMEIL collection.

I own several of the gold pieces and some occasion Ive gifted them to my friends and highly recommended it. But last year, I decided to purchase their vermeil collection as the design I.e. dome croissant come to my liking however after one year in and suddenly one day when I opened my jewelry box I found the pieces in discolored form completely turned blue-purpleish. I got so worried and looked up their company warranty policy and was glad to see that product was under it. But was sad to find out about when their customer service told me that it doesnt qualify under accidents scenario, when I honestly told them that it mightve came in contact with hand sanitizer as in todays situation which is so difficult to avoid. However, with my constant afford to restore my pieces they finally agreed to send me a LITERALLY a 2X2 inch polishing cloth. It did the job but I am so disappointed and even regretted purchasing their vermeil piece as I expected the quality could have been much higher with the price point we paying so it wont be easily discolored or tarnished 😔 As it almost loosing my faith in their pieces and sort of drifting me away in making future purchases from them.",New York,8,2/10/2022 0:00,Mejuri,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,T.

Lovely jewelry but skip the SoHo store — there is a long line to get in and after you purchase something theyll ask you to wait outside (took ~10 minutes) while they get it from the back. On a super hot summer day (and also trash day no less) its not an ideal experience as a paying customer to stand outside next to a pile of steaming trash after you spent hundreds of dollars in the store. Surely they could have a waiting area inside.

The store is lovely and the jewelry is beautiful. Im not sure if only 1 staff is allowed to be at each counter but when I was there I was looking for earrings. The counter where they were at already had 2 other customers and another 2-3 came after me. The girl was very nice and trying to help everyone. However there was another staff right across on a counter that had no customers at all. Perhaps it would have been best to have her come over to help. I understand you dont want to leave an open counter with jewelry unattended but there should be a better system for helping customers.

"Had an amazing one on one stylist experience at Mejuri ! I booked the one on one because I know how crazy the store can get, and I was hoping to sit down with someone to find my wedding band. I looked at the website before my appointment so I had some ideas in mind. When my fiancé and I arrived they had everything prepared, including the styles I liked and some refreshments. One of the styles I picked ended up being the winner. I loved being able to try it on in person and see how it looked with my engagement ring (which is a family heirloom btw!) My fiancé and I left thrilled that I found my winning wedding band, and to our surprise it arrived about a day and a half later at my house.

"Super nice & personable staff! But the quality of the Jewlery is really questionable…. Ive had issues with now 2 pairs of earrings from them & with the price point it wouldnt really make sense to pay almost $300 for a pair of earrings that just fall off your ear after 1-2 months of wearing them. Also gotta kick rocks if you do because warranty doesnt cover that! The make and quality is just, weird? White gold but I dont know…. Cheap white gold? Ive never had earrings just fall off my ear. The earring backings on most of their earrings are so cheap looking and cheaply made. For the earrings that clasp on, they just arent made the best so the clasp ends up not… clasping.. They suggest to buy plastic earring backings from Amazon to help keep them in.

I had a wonderful experience at this store! I drove over an hour to get here for the chance to try on the pieces and it was very worth it! The associates were all helpful and welcoming. They definitely made shopping easy and more fun! I spent about an hour trying on everything I was interested in online and it was SO helpful in selecting a pretty stack that looked good on me. They have a system where you put the earrings you try on a dish and sanitize each item before returning them to display ~ this made me feel really safe to try everything.,Bethesda,0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Anna Mateo,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['helpful', 'welcoming'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['try on', 'shopping easy', 'sanitize'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['interested online'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['pretty stack', 'system']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Online Shopping Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection,helpful | welcoming | try on | shopping easy | sanitize | interested online | pretty stack | system

"Mejuri is based in Toronto, Canada and has made itself known for its fine and semi fine jewelry. Mejuri offers a large range of accessories from Diamond rings to Amethyst bracelets, carefully crafted with sustainable materials.As someone who loves fine jewelry but understands the importance of budgeting I love how Mejuri is so budget friendly starting at just 35$. Mejuri is a step in the right direction for luxury jewelry that is both accessible and sustainable.Having worn multiple of Mejuris pieces, Ive found them to be quite modern yet elegant. This jewelry is luxurious, sustainable, and practical for everyday wear.Some pros of Mejuri are its affordable price, quality materials, and sustainability but it does have a few cons. Some pieces are less durable and dont last as long as some of the more expensive pieces and some people find it to have too little range of styles.Mejuris products are aimed towards people with more modern values of quality and ethical purchasing. Its for the people who want some luxury to their lives without having the quilt of being too extravagant.The shopping experience at Mejuri is straightforward with a user friendly website and clear descriptions of products. Alternatives to Mejuri that fit its ethical and quality standards are Catbird and Blue Nile.Overall I would give Mejuri 5 stars for its commitment to making quality and ethical luxury jewelry. Although it might not fit everyones style its a compelling option for those looking for cheap, sustainable, and quality luxury jewelry.",Bethesda,1,6/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Hen Rockman,"{'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['large range', 'Diamond rings', 'Amethyst bracelets'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['budget friendly', 'affordable price'], 'Affordable Luxury & Investment Value': ['luxury jewelry', 'accessible', 'cheap'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['less durable', 'quality materials'], 'Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal': ['modern', 'elegant'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['user friendly', 'clear descriptions'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['everyday wear', 'practical']}",Store Organization & Product Selection | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Affordable Luxury & Investment Value | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal | Online Shopping Experience | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience,large range | Diamond rings | Amethyst bracelets | budget friendly | affordable price | luxury jewelry | accessible | cheap | less durable | quality materials | modern | elegant | user friendly | clear descriptions | everyday wear | practical

"I had a terrible experience with Mejuri. The first pair of earrings I bought was defective—the clasp on one wouldnt open, and it got stuck in my ear. When I finally managed to get it off to send it back as a defective product, they had the audacity to claim the earrings werent in the box. Whether it fell out due to their mishandling or they didnt properly check, thats on them. Why would I keep defective earrings?Still, I decided to give them another chance and ordered a new pair. The same issue with the clasp happened again. This time, I checked the clasps immediately after opening, and they went right back in the box and were shipped back. Mejuri then claimed the earrings were in ""bad condition"" and refused to refund me—even though they never left the box for more than a few seconds.This company operates like a scam.

"Problem number 1# 14K gold fades the gold sheen with in a month and half just from sweat and exposure to air. Jewellery is meant to be worn. They should consider protective coating for longevity and durability. which the Jewellery does not have.I bought the garnet and gold ring. The fading was a fate I had accepted for an $800 ring. I shouldnt have because $800 could get you 22k rings which would have resell value. But the choice is yours.Problem number 2# Damages easy. I got a second ring for $515 the croissant ring. Wore it once. When buying it I asked if I am able to return this if I dont like it tomorrow, the sales rep responded yes.I came back to find out this wasnt eligible for a return because theres a slight scratch (invisible to my eye but they apparently have equipment in the store). I was only give the option to exchange. I told her that it did not make sense she is taking back the ring anyway but not letting me take the money back. Pretty scamy since mejuri swears on sustainability and using recycled gold and silver upto 90+ %. Store manager with red hair mentions the store will not be able to sell it and LOSE money. And she was sorry the sales rep had a miscommunication and did not tell me the conditions of return especially when I asked if I will be eligible to return.This wont  reach you, but Sales reps.

When youre buying they always tell you all about the refund/exchange flexibility and warranties and wonderful perks wow what a respectable store youd think.And then lo and behold, they sell you a defective earring and you gift it to someone and they open it and try it on right in front of you and a group of people, only to realize the earring doesnt clip… What an embarrassing situation to be put in the first place, for something valued 650$+!

"Buyer beware:I bought a necklace and pendant for my wife recently at that store. She really loved it but unfortunately it was too small so about 2 weeks later she went to the store to exchange it for something else. She was very excited to do so as she really liked Mejuris products.To her shock, the store refused to take back the necklace arguing that it was not up to their required standard for a return. My wife explained that the necklace was only worn for about 5 minutes to try it on before she decided it was too small. There were no visible issues to us, no scratches or anything of that nature. The staff simply said they did a test and the necklace had lost its shine. We tried to explain that whatever issues they think there is with the necklace, it was sold to me in that same condition. No success. It was as if we were trying to explain to them that we are not trying to scam them or something. It was a humiliating experience.I contacted customer service online, explained the situation and sent them pictures of necklace. They agreed that it was in perfect condition and sent me a return label. I had to then go through the hassle of shipping it back myself and wait a couple of weeks for reimbursement.Unless you are buying something for yourself and know for certain that you will not in any scenario want to return the item, buy at your own risk because there is no guarantee the store will accept their product back even if it is in perfect condition.",,14,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Karim Haddad,"{'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['return label', 'shipping back', 'reimbursement'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['refused', 'humiliating experience'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['store refused', 'customer service'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['lost shine', 'perfect condition'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['buyer beware', 'own risk']}",Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,return label | shipping back | reimbursement | refused | humiliating experience | store refused | customer service | lost shine | perfect condition | buyer beware | own risk

"EDIT:Since writing this review, Mejuri has really made a big effort to right a wrong which is very much appreciated. They were having inventory issues and couldnt send me the backings. They sent me the piece I was missing as soon as possible and even sent me a gift for the unfortunate inconvenience I had went through.—————————————-I got a piercing during the opening weekend at the Montreal store back in January. I was told that I was going to get another follow-up appointment 2 months later to resize the flat back stud once the swelling went down.It seems they only had a piercer for the opening weekend because they no longer have a piercer to do the follow up appointment that was included with my purchase. I have called and I have visited the store and each time they say they are really close to hiring a piercer professional and that they cant give me the resized flat back stud because only a professional can handle it since it must be sanitized. I had left my contact information with them saying that they would reach out to me as soon as a piercer was available but, never heard back.I finally decided to contact the Custom Happiness Team and they said they would follow up with me and that I can always set up an appointment at their Toronto location. Another two weeks pass by and still no resolution. Unless the travel expenses would also be included in my follow-up appointment in Toronto, I am getting the sense that I am being placated time and time again without them actively trying to resolve their mistake.I find this highly irresponsible that Mejuri would offer a service for their opening weekend without making sure their clients would have the proper aftercare.",,2,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,4,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Marilina Cianci,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['never heard', 'two weeks', 'no resolution'], 'Professional Piercing Services & Environment': ['piercing', 'flat back', 'piercer professional', 'sanitized'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['follow-up appointment', 'contact information', 'follow up'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['inventory issues', 'proper aftercare'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['opening weekend', 'Montreal store'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['right wrong', 'gift', 'Custom Happiness']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Professional Piercing Services & Environment | Communication & Policy Consistency | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Store Organization & Product Selection | Exceptional Customer Service & Support,never heard | two weeks | no resolution | piercing | flat back | piercer professional | sanitized | follow-up appointment | contact information | follow up | inventory issues | proper aftercare | opening weekend | Montreal store | right wrong | gift | Custom Happiness

"Mejuri is a hit or miss - I love all my rings and bracelet, but beware of earrings. I have different sizes of hoops and they have the worst clasps. Bought, along with my mother the Pavé Medium Hoops for my birthday and after wearing them twice, lost one on my third wear!! When trying them on in store, I had asked the sales rep regarding the clasp, but she said it was fine, that sometimes you need to clip it harder. Half of $600+tx down the drain. Heartbroken.Edited:As a customer who had raised the issue with the sales representative, who assured me there was no issue with the earring, Mejuri still blames me for the loss of the earring. Train your employees better. Craft your jewelry better. Very disappointed with the service.Also avoid the piercing studio! I have 12 piercings, 2 from here and both have gotten infected.

"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS.They attempted to host an exclusive event for M+ members on Nov 10,2024 at Yorkdale and failed the set capacity limits on the number of people who could rsvp to the event. We showed up at our designated time slot only to find hundreds of people lined up on a first come first serve basis.There was no order to the chaos.We were given mixed information but several different employees. One blonde girl only knew how to apologize she didnt really provide any help or answer questions. Another asian girl with blonde hair said someone would come through the line to take orders for people who knew what they wanted. And that did not happen. By the time someone else said there was a separate line to order outside the store that was after 1.5 hours of already waiting in the line. There were people making returns and ordering things online for pick up despite this being an after hours event. The mall closed at 7pm why are they taking regular transactions at the time of this special event. People were see skipping and hopping in and out of line.The girl (who said she was new she started in July) manning the line could not get through the entire line in over 2.5 hours because she kept on checking some peoples tickets then running back into then came out minutes later just to check a few more people and would continuously forget where she left off. If she just kept going through the line a lot of misinformation would not have been spread around and it would have made her available sooner to help people check out. She also did not actually check everyones ticket either some people around us didnt get checked. Once your ticket was verified there was no way to confirm that at the door, not that they were checking. So people hopped in and out of line after she checked that part of the line. Then after she was eventually done checking the line after 2hrs and 45 min, she didnt contribute to helping any other customers she just chatted with people in line. She also had the good sense to bring out 3 drinks for 3 people when there was still 2 dozen people who hadnt had any drinks. So not really sure why she was put in charge of manning the line she did an extremely poor job of it.They eventually started handing out drinks to the customers in line 2 hours into the wait and then the people at the end of the line had to wait 45 minutes to get their drinks because the person handing out drinks needed a break supposedly. I wasnt aware that handing out drinks required a specific skill set they were non alcoholic.The manager refused to come out to address any customers and said he had no power to do anything. There was no apology or consideration at all and definitely no customer service experience at all. So Im not sure what your purpose is if youre a manager of a store and cant fix any customer issues or make any helpful decisions.I had a 7pm time slot and i saw people who had later time slots than me at 730 and 8 get helped and get items before me.Do not be fooled by Mejuri and their shiny objects, they have no common sense, no customer service experience, no competence. Especially at Yorkdale as well which is supposed to represent a client focused luxury experience mall.The photo attached does not show the line that went towards mac cosmetics to banana republic and then back and down all the way to babaton. You can see there is just a mass amount of people standing around the front of the store as well with no line organization or employees to organize these people which also created a safety hazard since the store is really not that big either.The event was supposed to be from 7-9 and i selected a 7pm time slot and after waiting over 2.5 hours I walked away without going into the store and a lot of disappointment.As someone who has spent quite a bit of money at Mejuri and who advocates for small businesses especially local to Toronto I am very disappointed by entire experience and will not be a returning customer.",North York,1,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Tiffany Cheung,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['TERRIBLE CUSTOMER', 'waiting 2.5', 'mixed information', '2hrs', 'refused', 'mass amount'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['misinformation spread', 'different employees', 'no power'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['no order', 'line organization', 'safety hazard'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['exclusive event', 'Yorkdale', 'capacity limits'], 'Professional Piercing Services & Environment': ['no competence', 'poor job'], 'Customer Service & Support': ['no apology', 'no consideration', 'refused', 'cant fix']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Organization & Product Selection | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Professional Piercing Services & Environment | Customer Service & Support,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER | waiting 2.5 | mixed information | 2hrs | refused | mass amount | misinformation spread | different employees | no power | no order | line organization | safety hazard | exclusive event | Yorkdale | capacity limits | no competence | poor job | no apology | no consideration | refused | cant fix

"Bought 2 gold stacker rings. Paid over 200.00 and when I received them I was not impressed. They were horrible. I put them on and knew immediately they would be returned. The quality was terrible.not worth the money.so I returned them in the same packaging they came in and requested my refund. Well today I received an email telling me that because I took a tiny label off them and because they were scratched I would not be getting a refund!!!! Are you kidding me? If these rings were scratched then I received them that way. I had them on for all of 5 minutes. They were so thin they looked like thread around my finger.

"1/5  Stars - Disappointing Experience with Mejuri Im writing this review as a cautionary tale for others. In July, I visited the Mejuri store in Yorkdale Mall, Toronto, to purchase a wedding ring set. I tried on several styles and ended up buying a wish bone ring set for around $600 after tax. The sales associate assured me that my ring size was 6, and I trusted that the rings I received were the correct size. However, when I opened the box on my wedding day, I was shocked to find that the rings were too big. To make matters worse, the customer service experience was appalling. I sent emails and received responses from at least 4-5 different people, including one who even got my name wrong! They eventually offered to let me return the rings for store credit, but we werent comfortable sending the rings back by mail and dealing with the uncertainty of the process. We took the rings to our local jeweler, who confirmed that the rings were actually a 7.5 - almost 2 sizes bigger than my correct size. Now were out of pocket for resizing the rings. But the final straw was when our jeweler called to inform us that during the cleaning process, ALL OF THE DIAMONDS fell out of the rings! Were talking about a supposedly high-quality piece of jewelry from a trendy brand, and it cant even hold its stones in place. Its unconscionable. Im extremely disappointed in Mejuris quality control and customer service. What should have been a special and memorable experience turned into a frustrating and costly ordeal.

"Edit:The social media team was much more responsive and helpful. They sent me a new pair of earrings and finally rectified the situation after two years. If you have an issue with the quality of the item you bought, I suggest you reach out to their social media team instead.Save your money and do not shop here! Their customer service is TERRIBLE!!! I spent $1,800 on my first visit at Mejuri. One of the earrings I was sold was faulty - the clasp on the hoop earring kept coming undone while I was wearing it. As a result, one of the earrings fell down the drain. When I contacted customer service, they said there was nothing they could do about it since the earring was lost.

"I drove from London to this store today so that I could try on a list of rings I had. I am an active Mejuri customer and was willing to spend a considerable amount of money here, as this was a gift for my 10 year wedding anniversary. The store itself is truly beautiful, and the first person who helped us out was very friendly (the second person was not). However, only two of the 6 rings I had come to try were available to try on in the store. For one of the rings, the employee couldnt even find it, nor had heard of it. I pulled it up on the website to show her and she basically just said that it must be discontinued 🤷‍♀️ Now, this wouldnt have been too much of an issue if I hadnt tried all week leading up to this visit (almost 3 hrs drive) to call the store to check if they had the rings I wanted to try on. No one ever answered, and I also left a voicemail requesting a callback. I had a completely wasted trip to this store all because no one would answer the phone. 6 hours round trip I will never get back. If you live nearby, sure, go visit this store because its pretty.

Deeply disappointed in your company. Firstly my earrings broke 3 times and the last time I had to change them to a cheaper one with a more reliable clip. Then I decided to use credit and ordered another earrings and paid for fast shipping. When I was ordering the system showed that the shipping takes 1-3 business days which I counted should be enough to deliver it before I leave the country. Once I placed the order system showed me that  there will be also a processing time and my order will be probably delivered 2-3 days later than it was shown before.

Everyone seems pretty done with their lives and didnt really pay me any mind. The associate I dealt with did the absolute bare minimum to look for a size for me and help me with my request. She made me feel a bit uncomfortable and I felt a bit pressured into buying the product. She even handed me the phone to do her job which is asking me basic details that were already in the system.

"Edit:Their team reached out over email and made great effort to invite me back and fix the situation. Changing to 3 stars.New to the Mejuri brand and I love a lot of the mens jewelry designs. But hoping corporate sees this review so the company can improve its customer service experience from online to in store:Whats the point of having your customers book an online styling appointment, fill in information on the specifics they need help with and the specific items they want to see, then to show up at your appointment and the staff in store have no information about anything you wrote down?It kinda kills the point of even having an online appointment system. When it comes to luxury goods like jewelry, the experience of purchasing the item is just as important as the item itself.I came in on time for my appointment expecting to see a few specific items (and wanted to buy them if they looked just as good IRL as online). Then I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes while the employee went back and forth to the back of the store telling me ""oh we cant find this, we cant find that. I can only bring you one item a time,"" then proceed to not talk to me at all while Im trying things on when she finally ends up finding the items (back room need better organization?). I ended up leaving before I even saw all the items I wanted cuz it was comical how bad the customer service experience was lol.Maybe the employees dont get commission so they dont care as much. Im not expecting a Chanel or Van Cleef level of customer service, but at least something on par with Apples organizational system where info is actually passed along would be great.",North York,3,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,3,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Rob Woe,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['waiting 20-30', 'bad customer', 'cant find'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['back room', 'one item'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['online styling', 'online appointment'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['no information', 'not talk'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['trying things', 'styling appointment'], 'Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal': ['jewelry designs'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['luxury goods']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Store Organization & Product Selection | Online Shopping Experience | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,waiting 20-30 | bad customer | cant find | back room | one item | online styling | online appointment | no information | not talk | trying things | styling appointment | jewelry designs | luxury goods
My boyfriend and I went to Yorkdale mall  to look for a gift for my birthday  it was yesterday June 18th.As we walk around we came across at the MEJURI store we saw a line up and wanted to check it out.My boyfriend liked these pair of Pavé Diamond Bold Huggie Hoops and he purchased them for me.I wore it at work today to show everyone I almost lost one because the clasp was defective.Furious  beyond words.I tried to call them today left several messages no one returned my calls.Got a hold of the live chat who tells me to ship the earrings back so I could get a new pair shipped to me.Terrible customer service and the company has not standard or customer service.I was better off going into Tiffany and be satisfied than upset.Wont visit this store ever again…..😝I wont recommend you will be very upset go elsewhere and invest your money in better quality.Should have checked the reviews no wonder why the rating is so low 👎.,North York,1,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Filu S,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['line up', 'no one', 'live chat'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['clasp defective'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['left messages', 'terrible customer'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['better quality', 'invest money'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['ship back']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Communication & Policy Consistency | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling,line up | no one | live chat | clasp defective | left messages | terrible customer | better quality | invest money | ship back

"I never write reviews because theyre a waste of time. But Ive never been this upset with retail before. Bought a bracelet as a gift for a friend and it broke after one day. Wanted a refund because it was clear the design of the bracelet was the cause. Mejuri Yorkdale would not accept a refund and said I have to exchange it for the same bracelet when I know it will break again. I had to fight to get it exchanged for a different design and they also made it final sale. Why would someone want the same item if it broke after one day. Also, the manager at the Yorkdale mall who claims she has a lot of experience in the jewelry industry even went as far as blaming my friend for wearing it to sleep (bracelet broke overnight and was found next morning in bed).

"1 star is generous for this business.During Black Friday, my husband purchased two pairs of earrings for me.

I have deleted my review for Alannah as she is no longer working at Mejuri. The customer service at this location is atrocious!

"It was my first time visiting a Mejuri store. On August 23rd, 2024, I purchased a stud as a gift for a friend and booked a piercing appointment for August 25th. However, when my friend and I arrived on Sunday, we were informed that my appointment was not in the piercers calendar. Thankfully, I had taken a screenshot of the booking confirmation, which eventually allowed us to secure the 4:40 pm slot.Unfortunately, this situation led to a heated conversation with the piercer, Ella, who was quite rude to both my friend and me.

We showed up on time for our appointment for piecing and were asked to wait. When we were finally served we were told that there was not enough time to do the procedure because someone else was coming in and they didnt want to push them back even though they pushed our appointment. The piercing technician told us he didnt actually wouldnt work late because it wasnt fair to other people.

"I had two frustrating visits to Mejuri this week that left me highly disappointed. On my first visit, I witnessed an elderly woman struggling to enter the store with a walker while three sales associates stood nearby chatting without offering any assistance. As for my own experience, I called ahead to check if a bracelet was in stock and was told it would be held for me (was told the hold was approved by a manager and the sales associate took down my information). However, when I came in later that day, I was informed that the bracelet had been sold despite the prior agreement, and no effort was made to help me resolve the issue.A few days later, I called again to inquire about another item. After some back and forth, I was told they might have it in stock. When I asked to confirm the sales associate told me I can look if you want but it will take a while - If I am coming into the store I want to make sure the item is in stock. I was told they couldnt hold it for me, despite a prior associate having told me they can hold an item for me just days earlier. I also inquired about engraving a ring (was told the machine was down that day but would be running the following day).  When I arrived in store I was told machine was still broken—something I was never informed of by other stores, which had sent me to the Ossington location in the first place. The engraver has been down for months according to a sales associate.  The solution provided was that I keep checking back in the new year and hopefully it would be running.  This item was supposed to be a gift and now I will have to source and pay for the engraving.The communication between staff members was horrendous, and the lack of customer service was shocking.

"Poor quality jewellery! I went into this store asking if there was something they could do about the clasp that came off a necklace I purchased from Mejuri, I understand the product was out of warranty but youd think for the price point the jewellery should last more than a couple of years. What was particularly disappointing was going in and being told ""your best bet would be to go to a jeweller to get this fixed"" confused, I looked around and asked ""isnt this a jeweller?"" The woman at the front counter shrugged it off and went back to what she was doing. If youre looking for good quality jewellery for a decent price point I recommend the nearby store Armed on Dundas.

"I would recommend to go find other places if you want to get ear piercing. Some professional piercing studio with reliable service quality. I should have done my research and read the review before getting my piercing done here.I had good experience back then when this store was located on Dundas st. and when they used to bring a local piercing parlour to their store and throw so called a piercing party. So I decided to try their piercing studio this time.On a day before my piercing appointment, I checked their website for available piercing jewelry. I didnt want anything too fancy, so I went for my appointment with $98 ones in my mind. On the day, basically I had only 5 choices, 2 of the options were $128 each, others like $300+. Ok, $30 x2 over the budget was find enough, so whatever.When the time for my check up appointment approached, it got cancelled, rescheduled, and cancelled again.

"I will never shop at Mejuri again after dealing with the manager at this location.For Christmas, my mother got me a ring from this location but sadly it was slightly too small. When I went to exchange this ring, I brought all the receipt cards that my mom had been given, but they told me I couldnt exchange the ring.  The ring my mother bought was not associated with those order numbers.There was no record online as well that my mom bought this ring or that it was associated with her credit card.Long story short, after spending 2+ hours over the phone and in store trying to resolve this issue, we discovered that at the time my mom was checked out, she was checked out incorrectly for the wrong ring. We did not have the croissant ring (that ring has been discontinued), but was charged 98$ for it, and the ring we bought was the charlotte bold ring (128$).We were accused of stealing the ring multiple times even though their sales rep made a big mistake and admitted that that must have happened. Upon exchanging the ring we had the full packaging (bag and box and exchange/return tag) and all the receipt cards yet we were still accused by the sales rep and the manager.We were nice enough people to just pay the difference in price for the ring instead of arguing.

"Ive had some quality gripes with Mejuri lately- everything from my gold vermeil ring tarnishing while it was still relatively new, to my 14k diamond initial pendant literally snapping in half within 9 months of purchase. Unfortunately, they were not able to honour their product warranty, as they determined that what happened with my pendant was not a quality issue on their end. But I would have to contest that that was definitely not the case. Im sure its easy for companies to just blame things like this on wear and tear to refuse warranty, but for an expensive, 14K solid gold with diamonds piece, I REALLY expected better from Mejuri.Mejuri used to pride itself on being affordable, but youre better off searching for 14K solid gold pieces on Etsy from independent, reputable jewellers. A lot of their pieces are universal designs (i.e. croissant ring, beaded ring, paperclip necklace) so you just have to know how to search properly.

"My wifes boyfriend suggested I get her some Croissant Dôme Hoops for our 2-year anniversary. I hate the fact that hes the one recommending stuff she likes — after all Im the one who married her.

The venue is very spacious, and the staff was super friendly. Between me and you, the Chicago staff was chill AF compared to Vancouver.

Do not waste your money coming here. Gorjana stands by their pieces and when you are spending 100 dollars on jewlery pieces you expect them to last more than a few months. Ridiculous.

"I dont even know where to begin. A year ago I bought 2 pairs of gold and diamond earrings that totaled to over $1K. Within days the clasp on one loosened. Within 3 months they started to tarnish. Went in store to show them and received store credit so I bought 2 other pairs. Within 4 days the clasp bent on one of them and I almost lost it. I reached out at this point requesting a full refund although their policy only does store credit. I explained that if I have to respect their policy I expect them to respect my expectations that when I spend so much on earrings I want them to last. I went back and forth for months with different reps. You can only text or email, no phone calls and I dont live in Chicago, I am out of state. They initially denied the warranty completely. I continued to explain how the clasp on this expensive earring broke quicker than any of my cheap Amazon jewelry. Then they agreed to fully refund me once I sent the products back, which I did. Once they received my earrings they sent another email saying they changed their mind on the refund and I can only get store credit because the product was returned bent??? Yes exactly thats why I dont want it anymore, because your jewelry is so cheaply made it cant even last a week. I literally do not want anything to do with them anymore and do not want any of their crappy,  poor quality and overpriced jewelry.

"I recently had an unfortunate experience at this location. Last week, a friend and I visited to purchase some pieces we had been eyeing and participate in their early access sale, which was invite only. We visited this store as soon they opened because my friend was traveling later in the day, and wanted to take advantage of the sale before she left. Since there were no signs up about the early accesssale, we asked staff about it.Several staff (honestly, too many staff) repeatedly asked if we actually received the invitation. Despite the fact that we knew more about the sale than your own customer service, they repeatedly asked--seeming to question whether someone like my friend would have actually received it. It was extremely odd. Now this would have been fine, but for the fact that after asking again and again, they then said they couldnt help because the sale wasnt until 7pm and there was no way to provide us with access to the sale ahead of that time.If that was truly the case, I dont know why we would be asked again and again whether we actually received the email.

It only covers damages to rings that are still in possession. Mejuri also offered for us to look at some other rings they have in stock and quoted the discounts available at that time.

"Worth the time and money.  I went into the West Loop location this past Saturday for the first time, and I am very happy with my experience with Jackie.  I made an appointment to get my ears pierced ahead of time and had a general idea of what jewelry I wanted to be pierced with.  They have a section in the back, by the piercing studio for you to select the allotted studs they use to pierce.  I am glad I arrived 20 min early.  It gave me enough time to double check if the jewelry online were the same and it was.  They dont have an option to tip, so I would recommend bringing cash.  ( I dont tip ppl for everything, however this qualifies it) I was lucky Jackie had a client that came early, because I had some concerns with a 40 yr old piercing my parents had done for me at 2 months old.  The old one was so high on my lobe and close to my head, and she took great time, patience and care to show me why she chose the location and exact position.  Needless to say, but I will, corp. needs to allot 45 min as standard amount of time.        This IS a lux experience, and the short window given to the piercer and client, puts a lot of stress on both parties involved.

"We purchased our wedding bands at this location. The bands themselves are great. Our shopping experience was an unending hassle.Our first visit seemed alright. The store had opened recently, so they had very low stock. They didnt have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes that we could try on. They did have bands of other materials in those sizes, and they helped us size our fingers. Then we bought bands in those sizes to be shipped directly to us—not ideal, but we hoped the sizes wed pegged in-store were correct. They reassured us that, if either of us needed to move to a different size, the exchange process would be a breeze.It was not. While one of our initial rings was a success, the other needed a new size. Returning to the store to exchange it kicked off a months-long comedy of errors. The clerks for this visit had trouble at every step—finding our order, processing an exchange, checking stock. After a very long wait, it was confirmed the store still did not have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes, so we would have to essentially place an online order again. To prevent having to return to the store again, they recommended we order the next two half sizes so both could be tried on, one kept and one returned. From there the clerks had immense trouble processing an exchange, at one point turning the iPad around to show it wasnt going through the way they were trying—was that supposed to prompt an, I see, Ill just keep an expensive ring that doesnt fit then? Finally, they seemed to have been able to process the exchange and set up the two rings to ship to us.Except:we received no email confirmation of the exchange or shipment. We had to call Mejuri corporate, who were able to track down our order. Apparently the clerks had associated this new part of the order with a completely new customer account. While Mejuri corporate was able to find this, as a result for every subsequent step of the process—tracking the two new rings, returning the one that did not fit, receiving a refund for that ring—required going through Mejuri customer service.As I noted, we are happy with our rings. And Mejuris customer service on the web/phone are very helpful and prompt. Thus my experience at this store would lead me to recommend that customers simply do all shopping at Mejuri.com rather than in a store, and/or that Mejuri do a better job setting up its physical stores by having adequate stock and preparing their clerks for more situations than the simplest of sales.",Skokie,0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,2,"4999 Old Orchard Shopping Ctr Suite B34, Skokie, IL, United States",IL,Andrew Rogers,"{'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['low stock', 'basic gold', 'average sizes'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['long wait', 'trouble processing', 'months-long'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['exchange process', 'returning ring', 'refund'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['Mejuri.com', 'online order', 'customer service'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['email confirmation', 'customer account', 'corporate'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['expensive ring', 'rings great'], 'Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration': ['shipping directly', 'adequate stock']}",Store Organization & Product Selection | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Online Shopping Experience | Communication & Policy Consistency | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration,low stock | basic gold | average sizes | long wait | trouble processing | months-long | exchange process | returning ring | refund | Mejuri.com | online order | customer service | email confirmation | customer account | corporate | expensive ring | rings great | shipping directly | adequate stock

"Absolutely horrible customer treatment, there is such poor quality of communication as well as lack of respect for the customer in order for them to truly justify their desired wishes to the employees. The environment is very assuming and totally makes the customer uncomfortable by being seen with much prejudice.

"Buyer beware! This is a nice storefront with good branding, but dont let that fool you. Their products arent great quality, they do not adhere to their posted policies, and they have abysmal customer experience. I bought merchandise from them in late November, and exchanged for different styles a week later. During that exchange, my transaction was rung as store credit + purchase rather than refund + purchase, without informing me that this nullified my ability to receive a refund, were I to return these items. A week later, I returned these items and was refused my money back, even though all items were unworn, with tags, and had been purchased 7 days prior. They acknowledged their mistake and my compliance with their policy. But they feigned helplessness, stating that the system couldnt support them refunding my full purchase amount. Even with 2 weeks of escalations to their leadership team, they still refuse to do the right thing.It is so disappointing to have a business not act in the best interests of its customers and to be so dishonest and unethical in their transactions.

"Ive been a loyal Mejuri customer for years and have always enjoyed everything Ive purchased. About a year ago, I bought a sterling silver bracelet that I loved. Unfortunately, the clasp broke shortly after, so I went to the store to exchange it under warranty. I also needed to exchange a ring I had purchased because it wasnt the right metal for me.While the store associate and manager were very helpful, they had a hard time processing both returns in the same transaction, which ended up taking nearly an hour. When the associate brought out the replacement bracelet, it was a different metal than the one I originally bought. She explained that the bracelet had been updated due to issues with the clasp and that this new version was more expensive, but I was getting it at the original price. When I expressed my preference for a refund, the manager informed me that it wasnt an option, which left me feeling a bit trapped. In the end, I accepted the outcome.Despite this, I continued ordering online and had a great experience with all my other purchases. On my birthday yesterday, I visited the store and, to my surprise, saw the bracelet I originally ordered right on the counter. I explained my situation to Megan, who was helping with purchasing a new chain necklace. She noticed an exchange on my account and suggested that I bring in the bracelet so they could help me get the one I initially wanted and paid for.Before heading back to the store, I decided to call and speak with the store manager, John. He briefly explained that their system sometimes loses order information and that without the original order, they couldnt assist me. Unfortunately, they also couldnt find the warranty exchange that the previous manager had processed a year ago.Im very disappointed after being a loyal customer for so long, and will be taking my business elsewhere.

"I love Mejuris timeless jewelry and had been a fan of their online store long before I knew they had a location in the Domain. As with any store in the Domain, parking can be a pain if you just need to run in for something during a busy time, but the store itself is a breath of fresh air. Its so fun to see the pieces all together in person. The store is very calming and the check out process is seamless.  I also really enjoy that their stylists walk you through whats in your bag after you check out. Like explaining that theres a travel bag and cleaning cloth under the foam, or telling you what the little black strip is for. Its little but it just shows that they care and gives you an idea of how to take care of your jewelry instead of just assuming that youd know. I love the Mejuri has a range, from vermeil to solid pieces, at a really fair price. The pieces that I enjoy from them are timeless but modern. Ive bought a lot of gold from them over the years but just picked up my first Mejuri pearls (Bold Pearl Drop Earrings) and couldnt be happier with the earrings, the store, and the service I received while there.",Austin,0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,Amanda Schaefer,"{'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['breath of air', 'calming', 'see pieces'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['fair price', 'timeless jewelry'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['online store'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['pieces together', 'gold', 'pearls'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['stylists walk', 'cleaning cloth'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['explaining', 'check out'], 'Affordable Luxury & Investment Value': ['solid pieces', 'vermeil']}",Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Online Shopping Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection | Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Communication & Policy Consistency | Affordable Luxury & Investment Value,breath of air | calming | see pieces | fair price | timeless jewelry | online store | pieces together | gold | pearls | stylists walk | cleaning cloth | explaining | check out | solid pieces | vermeil

"A very interesting experience here last week, and hasnt been a positive representation of the company.Last week was getting coffee at Starbucks when two of the employees here were having a conversation. The taller blond, Got very loud at the Starbucks and was asked to go outside with the other lady with dark brown hair.I didnt think much until I came to look at some new pieces as Im an avid fan of Mejuri. The blond lady was present in store, but was not welcoming and had a smerk on her face. Possibly because she recognized me from Starbucks as she was asked to leave. I later found out that she was visiting from California and her name was Britney from my advisor.If Mejuri allows their upper management to talk to store staff this way, I will no long shop or recommend Mejuri. Unhappy people deserve jobs where they are not face to face with employees. Maybe she isnt face to face often, but a simple smile would change my experience in store.

"I should have read the reviews on more than one site. Apparently the clasps on the earrings dont hold. After wearing them to the car and into a store, my daughter realized one had fallen out. Since it was lost, they do not consider it a warranty issue and will not replace the one earring. She wore them twice. Your better off throwing 50 bucks out the window then buying their earrings. Now after the fact, Ive read numerous reviewers saying the same exact thing. Mejuri refuses to accept responsibility for faulty clasps. Also, I ordered 2 items for Christmas presents and they put them both in the same box.

Really excellent customer service. I had a super nice stylist today and her manager also helped with my account. The stylist picked out several pieces for me and showed me how they looked stacked. She also gave helpful tips on what to consider when stacking jewelry (eg consider the length of your jewelry at home; change the texture of the chain if the lengths are the same). I wish I could remember their names it was just earlier today! The stylist was a young Asian woman. In general everyone was very nice and the vibes at the shop were good. Would recommend.

"I went to Mejuri for the first time after being a longtime fan, but I was sadly disappointed with my experience. Beyond the security guard, no other employee of the store greeted me. I cruised around the store for maybe a solid 25 minutes before someone even offered me assistance or to inform me of the try-on procedures in the store. Despite my interest in purchasing the diamond cluster ring, no one actually bothered to assist me despite me verbally expressing my desire to purchase the ring. Everyone continued to ignore me and to help other guests. It wasnt until about 5 minutes prior to my exit that one associate offered me assistance.It left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth for the brand. While my experience does not reflect the brand as a whole, it did tarnish my perception of it. Additionally, I hadnt shopped at Mejuri since before the pandemic. So, it was exciting to see the pieces I was interested in in-person for the first time. But upon my visit, I came to find that much of Mejuris designs have changed. The rings appear even thinner and more fragile and delicate than when I first started shopping from the band. Dimond, pearl, and gemstone accents are miniscule on the rings. They are significantly smaller than when I first started buying from the brand.I understand they may have altered the designs to keep the prices affordable during a time where gold is at an all-time high, but they seem to have compromised quality for price. However, Im not so sure how affordable Mejuri is to the average consumer anymore. Along with my interest in the ring, I was also interested in some diamond hoop earrings from the brand and while I was browsing online at other vendors, I found nearly the same hoop earrings available at almost half the price at Zales.Overall, it seems times have changed for Mejuri and Im not sure if I will continue to shop there. For others, I would recommend exploring other options before purchasing at Mejuri.

Once you are ready to order, they will bring out an iPad and help you purchase it right then and there.

"I had long awaited this review. I had been here last november and asked for a flat from a piercer that seemed very nervous, shaky, and didnt even let me get a flat in the end, I left with a helix, that was crooked and never healed.About a month or two ago I had gone back to the location addressing my concern due to the fact that my helix wasnt healing and to begin with its not even what I asked for from the beginning, Modey was my new piecer at Mejuri that day and took such an amazing job of me, she had instantly said yea this needs to be fixed let me see what I can do for you. She ended up being able to fix my piercing with what I ended up wanting, I was a little hesitant at first due to my last experience but then she had really reassured me of her work in the process. Anyways fast foward about a month or two, I am so happy with my piercing! Modey was by far one of the best piercers I have ever been to and I have at least 20 piercings by other people, my flat looks great! and it looks ontrack to get the post downsized soon and be done healing! thank you so much Modey!

"I love the jewelry but all three piercings I got at Mejuri had to be taken out because they didnt heal properly due to improper piercings.

"The store is beautiful, and it is really nice to see all of the items that they have online in person.However, I didnt have the best experience with the setup towards ear piercing. First, I asked to be contacted when they had a piercer lined up (which the staff said they would do), and was never emailed. Then I signed up for an appointment online, and it was canceled because the piercers schedule wasnt updated online. When I finally got to my appointment, I was told I couldnt get my ears pierced because of a possible keloid scarring issue I may have had on one of my previous piercings although I was willing to take the risk. This was fair, but I feel like this could have been a part of the terms & conditions form I had to sign. Also, the piercer didnt want to do 4 piercings although the website allows up to four in one appointment.

Ive never wanted to leave a business so quickly. As I read other reviews it comforts me to know that this isnt just some figment of my imagination. This store I cant imagine will last long.

"I had a very bad experience in this Mejuri at W 4th in Vancouver, and Im still dealing with it years later.Two years ago, I got my wedding band at this store. A simple white gold band, with a letter engraved on the inside. Since then, two main problems came from it, leading me to spending a lot more to remedy the issue. Save yourself some trouble and dont buy there. They dont care about customer satisfaction.1. When it was sold to me, I tried different sizes to choose the right one and the customer service rep told me that I could always get it readjusted if the size wasnt right when I got it. When I got it, the size wasnt right so I went back to get it readjusted and they said that was not possible because of the engraving (no one had told me that before). I explained that at the store and they didnt care at all. So, I had to take it to another jeweler and pay extra to get the size adjusted in a rush before my wedding day.2. A few months later, the gold started to yellow and it didnt look like white gold anymore. I took it to the store and they said they couldnt do anything. I then took it to another jeweler and they explained to me that it wasnt fully white gold, but rather white gold plating with yellow gold underneath. This was not said to me when this store sold me the ring. So I had to pay for this other jeweler to re-plate it into white gold.After a few months, the same thing happened again, the gold started to yellow. I had moved away by that point so I took it to another jeweler in my new city and they told me the same, saying that every few months I would have to pay to have it re-plated if I wanted the ring to remain white because the ring was not made from white gold or a gold that could sustain that white gold/silver color I was looking for (and that was sold to me at the store).I would not have bought it if this store was honest about the products it sells; I wanted a white gold ring, and Im stuck with the wrong color.It wasnt cheap either.

"I recently visited this jewelry shop to purchase a bracelet and earrings. I brought two pictures of the items I was interested in and asked the female staff member to assist me in viewing them in person—one picture was of a bracelet, and the other was of a pair of earrings. However, the earrings she showed me were obviously different from the picture I provided. To make matters worse, the earrings I was asking about are one of their supposed bestsellers, so its baffling that she couldnt recognize them. The bracelet she showed me was also incorrect.When I proceeded to pay for the bracelet, I noticed that the price was different from what I was originally told. This means all the information she provided me was inaccurate. To add insult to injury, when I asked her for assistance in wearing the bracelet, she didnt even look at me or acknowledge me properly. She simply said, ""Okay, Im gonna help you,"" in a dismissive tone, unlocked the bracelet, and handed it to me. I struggled to put it on, and despite standing right next to me, she made no effort to assist.Its hard not to believe that she did this on purpose. Her terrible attitude and lack of professionalism made me feel completely unwelcome in the store. And seriously, how can a staff member not know their best-selling items?This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience Ive ever had. I will never return to this shop, and I strongly advise others to take their business elsewhere. There are plenty of other jewelry shops that offer better service, accurate information, and an overall pleasant shopping experience.

"I ordered some earrings online for black Friday to replace my old hoops. The old hoops completely snapped and pierced through my left ear, causing bleeding. I had asked in stores if Mejuri can replace the broken ones, and they said no. I still decided that with one good hoop from the previous pair left, it was worthy to give the brand another shot during their black friday sale. I went in to pick up my new earrings in stores last weekend - I spoke with a male employee with glasses to ask for help. It is difficult to describe this, but his tone of voice and expressions were rude, as if that I should not have been talking to him, or bothering him. I was told that I cannot pick up my order, because you need to present your photo ID, which I had no idea about. I asked if it would be okay to show them the order receipt and pick-up notification email instead as that is a proof of purchase. They said a cold ""No"", walked a couple of steps away from me, and left me standing at the counter… I looked at them helplessly as they stared at me in judgement and did not provide further customer service or assistance… I was quite taken aback and shocked at this treatment, but did not want to cause a scene and complain.. Moments after, I went to them and asked if I can speak to another staff member, and someone else came out from the back and handled the pick up thereafter.I find the unhelpful attitude and unprofessional initial encounter to be completely unnecessary. I hope the store can properly train their staff to provide bare minimum adequate customer service.Ive been a customer for the brand for quite some time, and going in stores to be treated in a disrespectful manner was very disappointing.",Vancouver,0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Ellen Jessica,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['rude', 'unhelpful attitude', 'unprofessional', 'disrespectful'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['completely snapped', 'pierced through', 'bleeding', 'broken'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['cold No', 'photo ID'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['ordered online', 'black Friday'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['cannot replace']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Communication & Policy Consistency | Online Shopping Experience | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling,rude | unhelpful attitude | unprofessional | disrespectful | completely snapped | pierced through | bleeding | broken | cold No | photo ID | ordered online | black Friday | cannot replace
My sister and I had great service at the Mejuri piercing studio. From the piercing itself to check up! I got my conch done and my sister got her midi back in December and had amazing service! They allowed us to go in together. The studio was beautiful. The piercing area was private and also just as beautiful and very clean. The piercer was so friendly and nice. Made the both of us super comfortable! She explained the process of both piercings and everything in between. We recently went back for a checkup and had a different girl but she was just as lovely. I will be getting any future piercings done at Mejuri.

"Edit:Mejuri reached back out to me to offer replacement of the defective cartilage hoop since it was still well within the warranty period.While I understand theyre not a luxury brand, their prices are by no means cheap, so Id expect better customer service from them. I purchased diamond hoops for my cartilage piercing a little over a year ago, which is still within their 2-year warranty period. The clasp on one of the cartilage hoops has been loose, falling off my ear a few times since Ive worn it. Understandably, I was concerned its only a matter of time before I lose it so I reached out to them for a replacement under their warranty which was rejected because apparently they expect me to remove my cartilage hoop everytime before I sleep and before each shower, which is impractical and not a common practice at all for jewelry meant for cartilage, helix, naval piercings. I have the exact same hoop on my other ear which has also been worn since I purchased it and has not fallen off, but they refuse to accept that this one may have been a bit loose from the start (a concern also raised by others in the reviews on the product, which I regret not paying heed to). Ive owned multiple different cartilage earrings over the past couple of decades and have never had this issue before. Please be mindful they dont offer repair for their jewelry which can be quite frustrating as a customer.",Vancouver,0,11/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,3,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Sudipti Katwal,"{'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['loose clasp', 'falling off', 'defective cartilage'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['warranty period', 'rejected', 'repair'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['not cheap', 'luxury brand'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['reached out', 'refuse', 'impractical'], 'Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality': ['cartilage piercing', 'helix', 'naval piercings']}",Product Durability & Quality Issues | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Communication & Policy Consistency | Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality,loose clasp | falling off | defective cartilage | warranty period | rejected | repair | not cheap | luxury brand | reached out | refuse | impractical | cartilage piercing | helix | naval piercings
"I just wanted to express how frustrated I am with Mejuri. My earrings clasp broke in my ear yesterday all of a sudden and Mejuri declined to change the piece as it was outside their 2 year warranty claim. The decision made is honestly outrageous and Im trying hard to understand how you qualify as a proper jeweller if youre unable to provide the below services:- Youre unable to REPAIR what you sell. This is literally in the description of a jeweller, it doesnt even have to be a luxury one as you claim you are.- Youre unable to buy gold which is the funniest thing. You cant even buy back the item that you already sold.- You refuse to renew the item.- Last of all, you dont even sell the earring in singles. The customer is required to buy the item again.I also want to mention that this clasp has been already broken twice and I had to change it in store. Its super flimsy and it really speaks for the quality of your so-called jewelery.

"My piercer was a 10 out of 10. From the start the piecer had great vibes. She helped me decide what to do with my tragus and it was over in a split second.

"1 star because I love the jewelry however the customer service could use some feedback.Upon requesting to purchase a set of earrings, the employee informed me they only had the single earrings in stock. I asked if I could purchase 2 singles for the price of a set as they did not have sets available in store or online. I was informed that they could not do this and as a result I feel this is poor customer service. To build customer clientele it would have been in their best interest to honour the price of a set.Secondly after purchasing a set online I lost one of the earrings which seems to be a common trend in the reviews. I realize this is a method of sales (so customers will purchase singles) however why not make the butterfly backings of good quality? Or perhaps offer alternative backings as well that tend to hold better.Generally speaking I do not find the service great here. It seems as though the employees are too busy chatting amongst themselves.EDIT:contacted customer support in regards to a bday discount code I received via email and accidentally deleted. Customer service via text is disturbingly not genuine (felt as if I was speaking to a robot). Could not provide me with discount code nor assist in any manner. Lack of professionalism.

"I had an excellent experience getting my lobes pierced in February (second holes). The piercing healed quickly and although it was expensive (minimum $75/earring+$25 piercing fee), I thought the quality of the earrings made it worth it. They pierce with threadless flat back earrings that are long to account for swelling and offer a free downsize after ~2 months after healing. When I was ready to downsize, I was notified that due to stock issues they did not have the shorter backs and it would be 2 weeks until they got them in. It has now been a month and I have still not been contacted about when they will be arriving. Once healed, the long backs get caught in everything and actually reopen the hole which is quite painful and can increase risk of infection. I finally have given up and bought my own short backs from a different company.  I also didnt realize the upgrade to the short backs is titanium not gold, so the cost of the earrings is really only for the very small front part of the earring. Im sure they will keep piercing and keep experiencing stock shortages forcing people to purchase their own backs or the Mejuri gold ones ($70) instead of the free downsize. After all of this, I dont think the cost of the earrings is worth it and the customer service I received has been pretty bad.",Vancouver,4,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Megan,"{'Professional Piercing Services & Environment': ['lobes pierced', 'piercing healed', 'flat back'], 'Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality': ['caught', 'reopen', 'painful', 'infection'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['expensive', 'quality', 'worth it'], 'Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration': ['stock issues', 'stock shortages'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['not contacted', 'two weeks'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['free downsize'], 'Price & Policy Transparency': ['$75/earring', '$25 piercing']}",Professional Piercing Services & Environment | Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Price & Policy Transparency,lobes pierced | piercing healed | flat back | caught | reopen | painful | infection | expensive | quality | worth it | stock issues | stock shortages | not contacted | two weeks | free downsize | $75/earring | $25 piercing

"Service was friendly and they were able to accomodate an exchange outside of the typical return period. However, I needed to decide where to ship a package.

I tried contacting both the shipping company and Mejuri customer service to hold the package but unfortunately could not get through to the shipping company and Mejuri customer service was unhelpful in resolving this issue.

"Bought a pair of 14K gold hoop earrings ($784 including tax)  online for my daughter and she was happy with it. No issue.I decided to place another order online for 2 bracelets and earrings that came to $656.32, but changed my mind and immediately tried to cancel. At first, they wouldnt let me cancel the order and I was told that they cannot cancel if its already being processed by their fulfillment team. I placed the order on Sept 28th and it wasnt shipping until Oct. 4th. I thought it was absurd that I couldnt cancel an order I placed on the same day. Worse, to be told they couldnt do anything about it. I said if they go ahead with the order that I would just contact my bank and dispute the charge. The sales rep replied back and said she was allowed to make an exception and that I was going to get a refund back within 5-10 business days.Long story short, yesterday was October 12th and I still have not received my refund after ten business days.

"Would give 0 stars if I could.I had a terrible experience at Mejuri. The sales associates were not attentive and they were extremely unfriendly. When you dont display prices, its expected that staff will be more engaging and provide you with all the product details —but that was not the case. I asked for prices of a few items, and the associate kept giving me rough estimates with annoyed expressions, as though I was wasting her time.When I asked for the price of a ring, she told me its around 50 and when I asked if that was before or after the discount, she simply told me, there is no discount on that, without asking how much I was planning to spend. The promotion was that you had spend over $150 to get discount. I had already set aside other items and would have easily qualified for the discount, but they didnt bother to offer any information and just assumed that i wont be getting a discount lolThe only friendly person with a smile was a guy who assisted me briefly, but even he kept walking away and disappearing in the back even as I was paying, which felt very unprofessional. It was clear that they werent interested in providing any kind of real service.I came in with intentions to buy multiple pieces, but after the poor customer service, I decided to leave with just one item—one I already knew the exact price of because I looked online.Jewelry stores used to offer a luxury experience, but at Mejuri, the associates attitudes reflect the same lack of quality Ive experienced with their jewelry.I wont be returning.",West Vancouver,3,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Sana Pierre,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['not attentive', 'unfriendly', 'annoyed expressions', 'walking away', 'disappearing'], 'Price & Policy Transparency': ['display prices', 'rough estimates', 'discount'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['wasting time', 'assumed'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['luxury experience'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['lack quality'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['friendly person']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Price & Policy Transparency | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Exceptional Customer Service & Support,not attentive | unfriendly | annoyed expressions | walking away | disappearing | display prices | rough estimates | discount | wasting time | assumed | luxury experience | lack quality | friendly person

"The sales associate was not at all familiar with products and pricing and told me that there was nothing in my budget of up to $150. I asked for pricing on a bracelet I was interested in and was told that the gemstone was a real diamond and therefore not in my budget. Ive since looked up the bracelet online and see its a topaz gemstone and the bracelet goes for $98. I also see another bracelet for $118 that was right next to the topaz one in store, and yet he told me theres nothing in the store in my price range. Ive shopped at Majuri before and have certainly seen items within $150, but with his lack of help and smug comment to brush me off, he made me feel like I wasnt ""good enough"" to help since I clearly cant afford to shop there. What is now clear to me is his lack of any product knowledge and his immense unprofessionalism. If the products at Mejuri are priced as high as he says, then perhaps their sales associates should learn more about them and care for the customers purchasing these ""big ticket items"".

"I had a really awful experience here. I asked to try on a certain ring but was unsure of my size and was given one to try on. After she gave me the ring, she would walk away to stand at the wall. I would have to try and get her attention again for a different size. I eventually did not care anymore and was clearly not welcome here as this employee ignored me and would walk away repeatedly. The store was nowhere near busy but I could not seem to get sized to purchase the rings I was interested in. I specifically came because I received an email about a members sale I wanted to take advantage of, but ended up leaving empty handed and never to enter this store again.

"Went there to do some xmas shopping and there were no prices listed, you have to scan a QR code which takes you to the whole website and not the individual item your looking at - so i was hoping someone could help me but all of the store associates were busy at that moment, so i waited and looked at other items - while that was happening i noticed other customers were getting greeted and asked if they needed help, where I wasnt at all from the moment i stepped in the door - it was actually frustrating and disappointing to see that indigenous customers are still treated this way - so while they were literally standing around ignoring me, i let them know ive been waiting for someone to become available or notice i needed help (since i was standing there for at least a couple minutes scrolling for the item i was looking for) but they didnt and thanked them for the lack of help and customer service - the sales associate literally glared at us and said nothing, absolutely nothing - this store is terrible and has terrible customer service - i left feeling frustrated",West Vancouver,0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Nicki L,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['no help', 'waiting', 'ignoring me', 'terrible service'], 'Price & Policy Transparency': ['no prices', 'QR code'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['glared', 'said nothing'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['whole website', 'individual item'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['scrolling', 'scanning']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Price & Policy Transparency | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Organization & Product Selection | Online Shopping Experience,no help | waiting | ignoring me | terrible service | no prices | QR code | glared | said nothing | whole website | individual item | scrolling | scanning

"Came to this location to purchase two 14k rings I had looked at online - the sales person was very helpful to find sizing and styling suggestions for stacking rings. They were sold out of one option I had wanted but online you can check stock so I will keep checking that. Prices are fair and jewelry is pretty. Good options between gold vermeil (plated) and solid gold. IMO it is worth the extra price for the solid gold, and their solid pieces are not too much more than the plated.

"1st time I went to the store had to leave because they dont take cash. That was fine service was good and girl super attentive I let her know that I had a voucher and she didnt hesitate to apply to my order immediately. Second time I took my card to buy the same items and the girl was quite unpleasant. Lots of knowledge about the product but quite an attitude that felt uncomfortable. Told her about my voucher and she couldnt care less. Had to remind her about that after she typed my total on the card machine and she rushed me to get the code. Ended giving up looking for the voucher, just wanted to leave the store as quickly as possible. She wanted to make that sale so badly that forgot that an actual human was paying for the merchandise.
