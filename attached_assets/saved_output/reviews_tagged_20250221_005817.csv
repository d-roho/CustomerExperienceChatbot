"I have been obsessed with Mejuri since the brand first hit the scene, and even more since they opened their doors! Usually when I visit I am greeted with bubbly faces and kindness, however, this past weekend (Saturday), I had a completely different experience. The store was packed and busy and the associates were helping as many people as they could, yet the harshness and cold demeanor of the store manager (Dani - I asked for her name) was extremely off putting. I have visited the store a couple of times now and have come familiar with the associates there, but this time around the manager who I was dealing with couldnt give me more than 2 seconds of her time. Within 2 minutes of our time together, she left me and the questions I had hanging and assisted another woman who walked in after me. Thankfully I was able to finish my shopping experience quickly and leave without more interruption. I will be back to Mejuri, because I LOVE their stuff, but I might stick to online for awhile....",New York,5.0,2/10/2022 0:00,Mejuri,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Mychae'l Green,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['cold demeanor', 'harshness', 'busy', 'packed'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['bubbly faces', 'kindness'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['left me', 'questions hanging'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['stick to online'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['love their stuff']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Communication & Policy Consistency | Online Shopping Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection,cold demeanor | harshness | busy | packed | bubbly faces | kindness | left me | questions hanging | stick to online | love their stuff,9ec9109c47424673bcb1571ad8f525bb
The staff was welcoming and super helpful as soon as I entered the store. The peices here are beautiful and minimalistic and great quality. I was allowed to browse and try on whatever I liked and I eventually found the perfect pair of earrings for a birthday present. Will definitely be coming back and will recommend to my friends.,Houston,0.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"888 Westheimer Rd Suite 158, Houston, TX",TX,Taylor,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['super helpful', 'welcoming'], 'Product Durability & Quality': ['great quality'], 'Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal': ['beautiful', 'minimalistic'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['try on', 'browse'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['perfect pair']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Product Durability & Quality | Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection,super helpful | welcoming | great quality | beautiful | minimalistic | try on | browse | perfect pair,34ad2400b3184f659020a10a93e4d645
"Horrible customer service, they really need to hire someone more seasoned to lead the Sales associates here. It seems like a group of high-school mean girls in their 20s working the store right now.My partner and I came in and werent even acknowledged, finally was able to wave someone down to ask for a ring size. Went up to go and pay for it (easy sale), and a manager was there with another associate talking, they both looked up, saw us waiting (RIGHT in front of them) and went back to their conversation about sales targets and how to greet customers....like maybe MAKE the sale right in front of you first? Or if you are unable to stop the training lesson, exercise some common courtesy and say Well be with you in a few minutes? Just really common sense stuff here especially if you are standing where people go pay. Anyway, will just order online instead.

"My mom and I had a great experience! All the employees who were there were very nice and friendly. There was one employee in particular who talked to my mom and I. He was very friendly and helpful! The store is small, but it was not super crowded. The employees were actively helping the other customers in the store. Youre allowed to try anything on, even the earrings! I love Mejuri as its one of the only jewelry brands I can wear. I definitely will be coming back!",Bethesda,3.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,Sonya Sun,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['very nice', 'friendly', 'helpful'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['try anything', 'not crowded'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['small store'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['love Mejuri']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,very nice | friendly | helpful | try anything | not crowded | small store | love Mejuri,0e281a01ebe64f818c230e42d95ca53f
