Was ignored for over 40 mins while other customers who came in after me were taken care of. I was the only POC in the store. I reached out online and said after exclusively buying from them for years I was really disappointed. Their customer service was VERY defensive. Never giving them another dime.

"The 1 star is only for the aesthetics of the store! The sales staff seemed extremely disinterested in helping. They all fit the description of typical snobs who help you based on what youre wearing/how youre looking. Even after me trying to signal to one of the sales associates for a question, I was being ignored. The one person who acknowledged me was the security who eventually requested a very unwilling sales associate towards me. The sales associate was rude, almost batting her eyes at me, and wasnt really helpful. Felt unwelcomed and would not be going there again!PS:this is after Ive been such a Mejuri fan and was in fact wearing their earrings that day.",Toronto,7.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Inayat Singh,"{'Store Ambiance & Visual Appeal': ['aesthetics'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['disinterested', 'ignored', 'unwilling'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['rude', 'unwelcomed'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['sales staff', 'sales associate']}",Store Ambiance & Visual Appeal | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Exceptional Customer Service & Support,aesthetics | disinterested | ignored | unwilling | rude | unwelcomed | sales staff | sales associate,dfebcad324584175b459b5bfe62ba0f2
