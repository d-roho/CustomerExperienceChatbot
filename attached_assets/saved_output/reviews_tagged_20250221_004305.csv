Needed to exchange rings because they were too small. One ring was mislabeled on the inventory.

"Went to buy a birthday gift for a friend and the staff helped us decide the perfect choice out of the options we were interested in. The jewelry we purchased was a bit difficult to find but Mejuri made sure we were as comfortable as possible during the wait with seating and refreshments, as well as generously providing a special add on to apologize for the unexpected wait time. Our friend absolutely loved her birthday gift. If you are ever at the Yorkdale location look for the manager Chris and hell make sure you are well taken care of.",North York,0.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,5,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,Tyler Cobbinah,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['staff helped', 'well taken', 'Chris', 'manager'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['seating', 'refreshments'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['wait time', 'difficult find'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['perfect choice', 'options']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Store Organization & Product Selection,staff helped | well taken | Chris | manager | seating | refreshments | wait time | difficult find | perfect choice | options,cdfc45c1e08e4c378f7115cccf953824

"I got my ring Christmas before last, and only got to wear it twice before it started to tarnish (or what I thought was tarnish) terribly. I took it out today to clean it, and it doesnt really clean the spots- using a jewelry cleaning cloth- the gold started to chip off on the bottom and in the spots near the gem! And speaking of the gem, it also cracked on the corner on my second wear (last picture)! I was so hopeful for the opportunity to wear this gorgeous ring but its falling apart after only two wears. Its way too late for a refund, but Im just bummed about it. It just sits in its box it came in.",Nashville,0.0,11/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"2803 12th Ave S, Nashville, TN",TN,Brandee Lee Elston,"{'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['tarnish', 'chip off', 'cracked', 'falling apart'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['too late', 'refund', 'bummed'], 'Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal': ['gorgeous ring']}",Product Durability & Quality Issues | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Aesthetic Design & Visual Appeal,tarnish | chip off | cracked | falling apart | too late | refund | bummed | gorgeous ring,7843570742ec44ce82d6844c78d9dcf0
