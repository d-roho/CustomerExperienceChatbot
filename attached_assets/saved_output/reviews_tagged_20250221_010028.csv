"Not to throw shade at the brand, I use Mejuri jewelry for some of my everyday accessories, meaning this was not my first time shopping from the brand, so I came in knowing exactly what I wanted. At first the young woman who asked me what I was looking for seemed like she was not in the mood for working. Without even making an effort to check, she first said that the earrings I wanted were not available in-store. Right after I said Ok, I guess Ill just make my purchase online she magically remembered they were in stock in the back room! The whole 5 minutes I was there she acted as if she was doing me a favor. Honestly, such a disappointing attitude from their staff for such beautiful stores with affordable and cute jewelry.",Brooklyn,3.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,3,"107 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY",NY,Alejandra Rodriguez,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['not mood', 'disappointing attitude'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['beautiful stores'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['affordable jewelry'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['purchase online'], 'Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration': ['in-store', 'back room']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Online Shopping Experience | Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration,not mood | disappointing attitude | beautiful stores | affordable jewelry | purchase online | in-store | back room,c4417d52cdba48f59b1b6ed36ea68ba4,"{

Came here ready to buy rings for me and my boyfriend but sadly they dont carry any ring sizes above 12. I ended up getting a ring for myself and it was beautiful. The process was quick and easy and we were in and out of the  store within 5-10 minutes.

"Probably the worst customer service I have ever encountered.I was told by one of their associates that they will process my refund next morning once their system updates. He  reassured me that if I purchase the item in-store they will process refund next morning instead of processing my in store pick up. If I wanted to make sure, I was told that I can always contact the store to follow up.No one picks up their phone even if I had called the store right at 10am. Mejuri online chat has been indicated ""chat offline try again later""Yet again it has been a few days and no one can get back to me with any solution.If I knew that my refund was not going to be processed as what I was told, I wouldnt have purchased in store at this location.I have been a customer of Mejuri for a very long time, and Im extremely disappointed with this customer service.",North York,1.0,9/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,lourdes,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['worst customer', 'no one', 'chat offline'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['reassured me', 'follow up'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['process refund', 'store pickup'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['online chat']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Online Shopping Experience,worst customer | no one | chat offline | reassured me | follow up | process refund | store pickup | online chat,3654e49c832d4b81ba62723e493f1224,"{
