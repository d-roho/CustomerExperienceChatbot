Great assistance from Rachel! She was super patient and even sorted out a delayed return on a very busy day at the store!,Vancouver,0.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,5,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,Saba Ghezili,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['great assistance', 'super patient'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['delayed return'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['busy day']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience,great assistance | super patient | delayed return | busy day,e18a9455fabb4329b9e82d685dc6a33f
"Mejuri is a hit or miss - I love all my rings and bracelet, but beware of earrings. I have different sizes of hoops and they have the worst clasps. Bought, along with my mother the Pav√© Medium Hoops for my birthday and after wearing them twice, lost one on my third wear!! When trying them on in store, I had asked the sales rep regarding the clasp, but she said it was fine, that sometimes you need to clip it harder. Half of $600+tx down the drain. Heartbroken.Edited:As a customer who had raised the issue with the sales representative, who assured me there was no issue with the earring, Mejuri still blames me for the loss of the earring. Train your employees better. Craft your jewelry better. Very disappointed with the service.Also avoid the piercing studio! I have 12 piercings, 2 from here and both have gotten infected. The piercer also didnt have the proper equipment, so had trouble aligning the needle with the piercing, which resulting in playing around to get it to fit until I couldnt take the pain anymore and we decided to repierce the hole.",,14.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,Charlotte Keogh,"{'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['worst clasps', 'lost one', 'craft jewelry'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['train employees', 'disappointed service'], 'Professional Piercing Services & Environment': ['piercing studio', 'proper equipment'], 'Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality': ['gotten infected', 'repierce hole'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['sales rep', 'assured me'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['600+tx', 'hit miss']}",Product Durability & Quality Issues | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Professional Piercing Services & Environment | Piercing Complications & Jewelry Quality | Communication & Policy Consistency | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,worst clasps | lost one | craft jewelry | train employees | disappointed service | piercing studio | proper equipment | gotten infected | repierce hole | sales rep | assured me | 600+tx | hit miss,4cfe172bde9d4d50b2834f55837167c7

"So happy this place opened! Been a fan for awhile (found them online while looking for bridesmaids gifts), but its so awesome being able to see everything in person. Shop assists are all super friendly/helpful. They have a piercing station. Best part:you get to TRY ON the earrings before you buy (they sterilize before returning to the rack). <3",Los Angeles,0.0,2/10/2020 0:00,Mejuri,5,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,Irene Young,"{'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['try on', 'see everything'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['super friendly', 'helpful'], 'Professional Piercing Services & Environment': ['piercing station'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['found online'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['sterilize']}",Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Professional Piercing Services & Environment | Online Shopping Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection,try on | see everything | super friendly | helpful | piercing station | found online | sterilize,26424de9880b473182c0778cdb910bab
