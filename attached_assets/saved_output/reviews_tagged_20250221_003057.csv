"The 1 star is only for the aesthetics of the store! The sales staff seemed extremely disinterested in helping. They all fit the description of typical snobs who help you based on what youre wearing/how youre looking. Even after me trying to signal to one of the sales associates for a question, I was being ignored. The one person who acknowledged me was the security who eventually requested a very unwilling sales associate towards me. The sales associate was rude, almost batting her eyes at me, and wasnt really helpful. Felt unwelcomed and would not be going there again!PS:this is after Ive been such a Mejuri fan and was in fact wearing their earrings that day.",Toronto,7.0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,Inayat Singh,"{'Store Ambiance & Visual Appeal': ['aesthetics'], 'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['disinterested', 'ignored', 'unwilling'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['rude', 'unwelcomed'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['sales staff', 'sales associate']}",Store Ambiance & Visual Appeal | Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Exceptional Customer Service & Support,aesthetics | disinterested | ignored | unwilling | rude | unwelcomed | sales staff | sales associate,dfebcad324584175b459b5bfe62ba0f2
"Bought a pair of 14K gold hoop earrings ($784 including tax)  online for my daughter and she was happy with it. No issue.I decided to place another order online for 2 bracelets and earrings that came to $656.32, but changed my mind and immediately tried to cancel. At first, they wouldnt let me cancel the order and I was told that they cannot cancel if its already being processed by their fulfillment team. I placed the order on Sept 28th and it wasnt shipping until Oct. 4th. I thought it was absurd that I couldnt cancel an order I placed on the same day. Worse, to be told they couldnt do anything about it. I said if they go ahead with the order that I would just contact my bank and dispute the charge. The sales rep replied back and said she was allowed to make an exception and that I was going to get a refund back within 5-10 business days.Long story short, yesterday was October 12th and I still have not received my refund after ten business days.  I contacted my bank and proceeded to dispute the charge.I canceled my order the same day I placed it and yet my card was still charged and no product was sent. THAT IS CALLED FRAUD!!!

"I lost my diamond tennis bracelet in June (clasp opened and slipped off my wrist). Devastated, I called the store, assuming that nothing could be done (not Mejuris fault!) however much to my surprise and delight the manager agreed to replace it free of charge, sending me a brand new one. As it was back-ordered, they told me it would arrive in August. It arrived yesterday (July) and I was elated! Only minor problem now was the reverse, whereas the clasp before was too loose (bracelet fell off) this new one had a super secure one, so secure that I couldnt take it off! I went to the store and it had a different open/close mechanism, but the store clerk recognized how difficult it was and offered to get me a THIRD bracelet, so that it would be perfect. Incredible above and beyond service, and I am over the moon that Mejuri replaced the first bracelet, and now again the second, as the clasp wasnt totally perfect. Truly wow-worthy service and Ive been shouting my story from the rooftops as Im so impressed with the brand!
