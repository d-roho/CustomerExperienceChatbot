"I have been buying from Mejuri for a few years now and really like their jewelry.That said, I recently made my first couple visits to the store and have been disappointed with the experience around order pick-up. At my first visit, I waited over 20 minutes for my name to be called after checking in. At my second, I waited 15 minutes, and 2 different people who I watched check in after me had their names called first. I also saw someone decide to buy a new item, pay for it, and get it packaged up all in the span of time that I waited. In both cases I was just buying a single necklace, nothing complicated. My expectation around pickup is that, since I got an email saying my order was ""ready"", it should be all packaged up and ready to go and handing it off to me should just be a matter of grabbing the right bag and not take 15-20 minutes each time. At this point it seems like Id be better off just buying items in-store and not bothering with the advance order and pickup.The employees have all been super nice and Im sure they are doing their best but it seems like the pickup process is flawed and/or they are really understaffed.",New York,1.0,2/10/2023 0:00,Mejuri,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,Kaitlin Mahar,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['waited', '20 minutes', '15 minutes', 'understaffed'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['order pick-up', 'advance order'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['email', 'ready'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['pickup process', 'flawed'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['super nice']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Online Shopping Experience | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Organization & Product Selection | Exceptional Customer Service & Support,waited | 20 minutes | 15 minutes | understaffed | order pick-up | advance order | email | ready | pickup process | flawed | super nice,e627fe5883234f37a57835d226bd5be7
