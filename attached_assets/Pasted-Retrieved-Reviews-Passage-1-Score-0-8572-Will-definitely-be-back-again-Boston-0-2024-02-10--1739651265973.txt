All of the salespeople were super helpful and accommodating, talking us through different pieces and helping us to find the right piece for our price point. I really appreciated their assistance and the selection of in store pieces is pretty wide-ranging.

They have quality pieces that are timeless and affordable. We would definitely recommend this location!,Boston,0,2024-12-10 000000,Mejuri,5,126 Newbury St, Boston, MA,MA,Suzy Chu, I came in to buy some hoops and the person who helped me made me feel very unwelcome. She didnt greet me at all and whenever I asked a question, gave me very short answers which made me feel very rushed. She seemed annoyed the entire time I was there.
