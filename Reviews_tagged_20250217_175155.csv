"I recently visited Mejuri and had a great experience! The store has a wide selection of beautiful pieces. The sales associates were incredibly friendly and helpful, offering great advice and making sure I felt comfortable throughout my visit and with my purchases.What really stood out was the piercing studio experience with Dawn (their in house piecer). She was not only knowledgeable but also professional and patient. Dawn gave me personalized ear styling tips, helping me select the perfect placement and jewelry that would complement my other piercings. The piercing studio is very clean and Dawn took great care in ensuring everything was sterile throughout the entire process. She used all the necessary precautions and followed a strict protocol to maintain a clean and safe environment, which made me feel even more confident in her expertise.Overall, I highly recommend Mejuri for both their beautiful jewelry and exceptional piercing experience. Its clear that they take great care in providing a top-notch customer experience!

I originally bought the wrong size chain. I went to Mejuri Chestnut Hill today and the staff was incredibly helpful. Great quality jewelry with a good mens line and exceptional customer service.

"Beware, this mostly online retailer has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. I purchased a pair of their earrings that I later wished I had returned as they were far to too heavy to be comfortable to wear. I tried to post an honest review on their site which strangely never appeared after multiple attempts, making me doubt the validity of their customer product reviews. If you purchase any of their products, I would first visit the store and view in person, rather than going by the reviews. I would also  be sure to save all of the packaging materials in case you are not completely satisfied with the product (which may be likely). Mejuri has not responded on why the website did not accept my review, but did tell me they pass along my product feedback.",Boston,0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Carolyn Cerva,"{'Online Shopping Experience': ['online retailer', 'website'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['too heavy', 'uncomfortable'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['not responded', 'never appeared'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['packaging materials', 'return'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['view in person'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['not satisfied']}",Online Shopping Experience | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Communication & Policy Consistency | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Store Organization & Product Selection | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,online retailer | website | too heavy | uncomfortable | not responded | never appeared | packaging materials | return | view in person | not satisfied
We had a lovely experience here at Mejuri on Newbury. The staff were warm and welcoming and helped me pick out a few new earrings to add to my collection. They have quality pieces that are timeless and affordable. We would definitely recommend this location!,Boston,0,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Suzy Chu,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['warm', 'welcoming', 'helped'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['pick out'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['quality pieces', 'affordable'], 'Affordable Luxury & Investment Value': ['timeless'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['lovely experience']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Store Organization & Product Selection | Value & Price-Quality Assessment | Affordable Luxury & Investment Value | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience,warm | welcoming | helped | pick out | quality pieces | affordable | timeless | lovely experience
"I came in to buy some hoops and the person who helped me made me feel very unwelcome. She didnt greet me at all and whenever I asked a question, gave me very short answers which made me feel very rushed. She seemed annoyed the entire time I was there. At the end of the purchase, she walked away without saying anything and went behind the counter so I awkwardly waited where I was until my earrings were ready. Everyone else seemed lovely so either she was having a bad day or I wasnt welcome. Its a shame because I was excited to visit and love the jewelry but I dont think Ill be going here again.",Boston,0,11/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Christine Byun,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['very unwelcome', 'seemed annoyed', 'walked away', 'awkwardly waited'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['short answers', 'didnt greet', 'rushed'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['excited to visit'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['love the jewelry']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Communication & Policy Consistency | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,very unwelcome | seemed annoyed | walked away | awkwardly waited | short answers | didnt greet | rushed | excited to visit | love the jewelry
"The ladies working at this location are amazing. It was hard to make a decision because I loved basically everything! The workers here were so patient and answered all of my many questions. I loved that you were able to take a close look at all of the pieces and even try things on.I have been so interested in trying Mejuri for a long time, but because it was all online I never bought anything. This store changed things for me and I will definitely buy again from Mejuri either in person or online.",Boston,0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Madison DeLacy,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['amazing', 'patient', 'answered questions'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['try things', 'close look'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['loved everything'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['all online'], 'Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration': ['store changed', 'buy again']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection | Online Shopping Experience | Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration,amazing | patient | answered questions | try things | close look | loved everything | all online | store changed | buy again
"Came in for an EXCHANGE for a gift worth $100, or for store credit. Went through 3 people in order to find someone who could help me do the exchange (everyone was too busy and told me to wait, which was fine). What was not fine was, finally, when they were helping me, the person REFUNDED to the original payment instead of store credit for an exchange. He even asked me refund to original? with his finger hovering the button, and before I could say NO he pressed it. And then, he told he couldnt undo the refund and told me to ask the original gifter (who is long gone to another country, btw - also do you know how awkward that is??). I obviously did not bother my friend about it again, but this customer service is???",Boston,0,12/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Ayra Enders,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['too busy', 'wait'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['EXCHANGE', 'refund', 'store credit'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['couldnt undo', 'ask original'], 'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['three people', 'helping me']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Communication & Policy Consistency | Exceptional Customer Service & Support,too busy | wait | EXCHANGE | refund | store credit | couldnt undo | ask original | three people | helping me
"Had a great experience shopping here on a weeknight when it was almost close. All of the salespeople were super helpful and accommodating, talking us through different pieces and helping us to find the right piece for our price point. I really appreciated their assistance and the selection of in store pieces is pretty wide-ranging. If they dont have something in store theyll order it for you easily and without fees or shipping costs.",Boston,0,2/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,5,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Lena Owens,"{'Exceptional Customer Service & Support': ['super helpful', 'accommodating', 'assistance'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['wide-ranging', 'selection'], 'Price & Policy Transparency': ['price point', 'without fees'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['order it'], 'Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration': ['in store']}",Exceptional Customer Service & Support | Store Organization & Product Selection | Price & Policy Transparency | Online Shopping Experience | Inventory & Cross-Channel Integration,super helpful | accommodating | assistance | wide-ranging | selection | price point | without fees | order it | in store
