"I recently visited Mejuri and had a great experience! The store has a wide selection of beautiful pieces. The sales associates were incredibly friendly and helpful, offering great advice and making sure I felt comfortable throughout my visit and with my purchases.What really stood out was the piercing studio experience with Dawn (their in house piecer). She was not only knowledgeable but also professional and patient. Dawn gave me personalized ear styling tips, helping me select the perfect placement and jewelry that would complement my other piercings. The piercing studio is very clean and Dawn took great care in ensuring everything was sterile throughout the entire process. She used all the necessary precautions and followed a strict protocol to maintain a clean and safe environment, which made me feel even more confident in her expertise.Overall, I highly recommend Mejuri for both their beautiful jewelry and exceptional piercing experience. Its clear that they take great care in providing a top-notch customer experience!

"Beware, this mostly online retailer has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. I purchased a pair of their earrings that I later wished I had returned as they were far to too heavy to be comfortable to wear. I tried to post an honest review on their site which strangely never appeared after multiple attempts, making me doubt the validity of their customer product reviews. If you purchase any of their products, I would first visit the store and view in person, rather than going by the reviews. I would also  be sure to save all of the packaging materials in case you are not completely satisfied with the product (which may be likely). Mejuri has not responded on why the website did not accept my review, but did tell me they pass along my product feedback.",Boston,0,1/10/2025 0:00,Mejuri,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,Carolyn Cerva,"{'Online Shopping Experience': ['online retailer', 'website'], 'Product Durability & Quality Issues': ['too heavy', 'uncomfortable'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['not responded', 'never appeared'], 'Complex Returns & Warranty Handling': ['packaging materials', 'return'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['visit store', 'view'], 'Value & Price-Quality Assessment': ['not satisfied']}",Online Shopping Experience | Product Durability & Quality Issues | Communication & Policy Consistency | Complex Returns & Warranty Handling | Store Organization & Product Selection | Value & Price-Quality Assessment,online retailer | website | too heavy | uncomfortable | not responded | never appeared | packaging materials | return | visit store | view | not satisfied

"I came in to buy some hoops and the person who helped me made me feel very unwelcome. She didnt greet me at all and whenever I asked a question, gave me very short answers which made me feel very rushed. She seemed annoyed the entire time I was there. At the end of the purchase, she walked away without saying anything and went behind the counter so I awkwardly waited where I was until my earrings were ready.

"Came in for an EXCHANGE for a gift worth $100, or for store credit. Went through 3 people in order to find someone who could help me do the exchange (everyone was too busy and told me to wait, which was fine). What was not fine was, finally, when they were helping me, the person REFUNDED to the original payment instead of store credit for an exchange. He even asked me refund to original? with his finger hovering the button, and before I could say NO he pressed it. And then, he told he couldnt undo the refund and told me to ask the original gifter (who is long gone to another country, btw - also do you know how awkward that is??).

"Matt, the head piercer at this location, was absolutely INCREDIBLE. He walked us through the piercing process with such ease and reliability. He truly made the process of my partner receiving their first piercing fun and safe! I also got to finally visit a storefront in person and grabbed a few earrings for my second holes in my ears and have loved wearing them everyday since. The staff was SO incredibly kind and even helped us take a polaroid of our visit with such joy. It only further enforced in me what I knew about this brand -- the quality and mission are incredible!

I love shopping at Mejuri online to get my wife necklaces and bracelets so we were excited to shop in store for the first time. Its a real shame that the whole duration no one helped us at all while the employee kept asking everyone else if they have been helped out yet. Also odd that the security person inside were following us the whole time and no one else. I guess Ill just stick to shopping at Mejuri online.,Brooklyn,0,8/10/2024 0:00,Mejuri,2,"107 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY",NY,Ilyas Mohd Yusof,"{'Poor Service & Long Wait Times': ['no one', 'kept asking'], 'Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience': ['following us'], 'Online Shopping Experience': ['shopping online'], 'Store Organization & Product Selection': ['shop in store'], 'Communication & Policy Consistency': ['no one helped']}",Poor Service & Long Wait Times | Store Ambiance & Try-On Experience | Online Shopping Experience | Store Organization & Product Selection | Communication & Policy Consistency,no one | kept asking | following us | shopping online | shop in store | no one helped
